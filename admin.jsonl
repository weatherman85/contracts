McRae\nName: Philip A.

In determining the Maximum Rate, due regard shall be given to all payments, fees, charges, deposits, balances and agreements which may constitute interest or be deducted from principal when calculating interest. If Chapter 303 of the Finance Code, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes, is applicable to this Note, and applicable state or federal law does not permit a higher interest rate, the \"weekly ceiling\" (as defined in Chapter 303 of the Finance Code, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes) shall be the interest rate ceiling applicable to this Note and shall be the basis for determining the Maximum Rate. If applicable state or federal law allows a higher interest rate or federal law preempts the state law limiting the rate of interest, then the foregoing interest rate ceiling shall not be applicable to this Note. If the Maximum Rate is increased by statute or other governmental action subsequent to the date of this Note, then the new Maximum Rate shall be applicable to this Note from the effective date thereof, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law.25\nInterest on the unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be computed on the basis set forth in the first paragraph of the first page of this Note (the \"Stated Rate\"), but in no event shall the Stated Rate be greater than the Maximum Rate described immediately above.\nIt is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of the undersigned and holder hereof (the \"Noteholder\") at all times to comply with applicable law governing the Maximum Rate or amount of interest payable on or in connection with this Note and the Loan (or applicable United States federal law to the extent that it permits the Noteholder to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a greater amount of interest than under law of the state in which the Premises is located). If the applicable law is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for under this Note or under the Mortgage or any other Loan Document, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received with respect to the Loan, or if acceleration of the maturity of this Note or if any prepayment by the undersigned results in the undersigned having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by law, then it is the undersigned's and the Noteholder's express intent that all excess amounts theretofore collected by the Noteholder be credited on the principal balance of this Note (or, if this Note has been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to the undersigned), and the provisions of this Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new documents, so as to comply with applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder and thereunder. The right to accelerate maturity of this Note does not include the right to accelerate any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and the Noteholder does not intend to collect any unearned interest in the event of acceleration. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Noteholder for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness evidence hereby shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding any provisions contained in this Note, the Mortgage or in any of the other Loan Documents that permit the compounding of interest, including, without limitation, any provision by which any accrued interest is added to\nthe principal amount of this Note, the total amount of interest that the undersigned is obligated to pay and the Noteholder is entitled to receive with respect to this Note shall not exceed the amount calculated on a simple (i.e., noncompounded) interest basis at the Maximum Rate on principal amounts actually advanced to or for the account of the undersigned, including all current and prior advances and any advances made pursuant to the Mortgage or other Loan Documents (such as for the payment of taxes, insurance premiums, repairs and other expenses or costs).\nTHE UNDERSIGNED AND ALL OTHER MAKERS, SIGNERS, SURETIES, GUARANTORS AND ENDORSERS OF THIS NOTE (a) WAIVE: (i) DEMAND, (ii) PRESENTMENT, (iii) NOTICE OF DISHONOR, (iv) NOTICE OF INTENT TO DEMAND OR ACCELERATE PAYMENT HEREOF, (v) DILIGENCE IN COLLECTING, (vi) GRACE (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE LOAN DOCUMENTS), (vii) NOTICE AND\n(ix) PROTEST AND (b) AGREE TO ONE OF MORE EXTENSIONS FOR ANY PERIOD OR PERIODS OF TIME AND PARTIAL PAYMENTS, BEFORE OR AFTER MATURITY, WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE HOLDER HEREOF.
