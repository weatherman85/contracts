Vesting

You can earn the PSUs awarded above based on IBM’s performance in achieving cumulative business targets of IBM revenue, operating earnings per share and free cash flow, weighted 40/30/30 respectively, over the 3-year Performance Period applicable to the award. For any Performance Period(s) prior to January 1, 2021, the business targets and weightings of operating earnings per share and free cash flow will remain 70/30, respectively. Performance against each of the targets will be subject to separate payout calculations according to the following table (which will be applied separately for each award of PSUs listed above):


% of Target                  <70%     70%     80%     90%     100%     110%     >120%

% of PSUs earned           0%     25%     50%     75%     100%     125%       150%


After the percentage of PSUs earned is determined, such percentage is further subject to a Relative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) modifier over the three-year Performance Period that could result in (1) the percentage of PSUs earned being reduced up to 20 points if the performance falls below the S&P 500 Index median; or (2) the percentage of PSUs earned being increased up to 20 points when IBM exceeds the median performance of both the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Information Technology Index. The relative ROIC modifier has no effect on the percentage of PSUs earned when IBM’s ROIC performance falls between the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Information Technology Index median. The final number of PSUs earned under this Award is generally determined after the ROIC modifier is applied. In the event the final percentage of PSUs earned is 0% based on IBM’s performance in achieving cumulative business targets of operating earnings per share and free cash flow, the relative ROIC modifier would not apply.

Payout of Awards

Following the Date of Payout, the Company shall either (a) deliver to you a number of shares of Capital Stock equal to the number of your earned PSUs, or (b) make a cash payment to you equal to the Fair Market Value on the Date of Payout of the number of your earned PSUs at the end of the Performance Period, in either case, net of any applicable tax withholding, and the respective PSUs shall thereafter be cancelled.


All payouts under this Award are subject to the provisions of the Plan, this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions document, including those relating to the cancellation and rescission of awards.

Terms and Conditions of Your Equity Award:


Provisions that apply to all Award types and all countries


The following terms apply to all countries and for all Award types (Restricted Stock Units, Cash-Settled Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Performance Share Units).


Cancellation and Rescission


All determinations regarding enforcement, waiver or modification of the cancellation and rescission and other provisions of the Plan and your Equity Award Agreement (including the provisions relating to termination of employment, death and disability) shall be made in IBM’s sole discretion. Determinations made under your Equity Award Agreement and the Plan need not be uniform and may be made selectively among individuals, whether or not such individuals are similarly situated.


You agree that the cancellation and rescission provisions of the Plan and your Equity Award Agreement are reasonable and agree not to challenge the reasonableness of such provisions, even where forfeiture of your Award is the penalty for violation. Engaging in Detrimental Activity (as defined in the Plan) during employment or after your employment relationship has ended may result in cancellation or rescission of your Award.


The cancellation and rescission provisions of the Plan may be triggered by your acceptance of an offer to Engage in or Associate with any business which is or becomes competitive with the Company, or your engagement in competitive activities after your employment relationship with IBM has ended if: (i) on or prior to the grant date stated in your latest Equity Award Agreement you have entered into a Noncompetition Agreement with IBM; or (ii) the Award is a Retention Restricted Stock Unit award. Notwithstanding the above, the cancellation and rescission provisions of the Plan will apply to all Awards if during your employment with IBM you engage in any Detrimental Activity, including competitive activities, described in Section 13(a) of the Plan.


For the avoidance of doubt: (a) all other cancellation and rescission provisions of the Plan will apply to all Awards if after your employment relationship has ended with IBM but during the Rescission Period you engage in any Detrimental Activity described in Section 13(a) (excluding Section 13(a)(i)) of the Plan; and (b) the cancellation and rescission provisions of the Plan will apply to all Awards if during your employment with IBM you engage in any Detrimental Activity, including competitive activities, described in Section 13(a)of the Plan.


Jurisdiction, Governing Law, Expenses, Taxes and Administration


Your Equity Award Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law rules. You agree that any action or proceeding with respect to your Equity Award Agreement shall




Equity Awards: February 1, 2023

Page 6 of 16


be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in New York County or, Westchester County, New York. You agree to the personal jurisdiction thereof, and irrevocably waive any objection to the venue of such action, including any objection that the action has been brought in an inconvenient forum.


If any court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of your Equity Award Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of your Equity Award Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.


If you or the Company brings an action to enforce your Equity Award Agreement and the Company prevails, you will pay all costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with that action and in connection with collection, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.


If the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that it has incurred or will incur any obligation to withhold taxes as a result of your Award, without limiting the Company’s rights under Section 9 of the Plan, the Company may withhold the number of shares that it determines is required to satisfy such liability and/or the Company may withhold amounts from other compensation to the extent required to satisfy such liability under federal, state, provincial, local, foreign or other tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are not withheld, the Company may require you to pay to the Company any amount demanded by the Company for the purpose of satisfying such liability.


If the Company changes the vendor engaged to administer the Plan, you consent to moving all of the shares you have received under the Plan that is in an account with such vendor (including unvested and previously vested shares), to the new vendor that the Company engages to administer the Plan. Such consent will remain in effect unless and until revoked in writing by you.
