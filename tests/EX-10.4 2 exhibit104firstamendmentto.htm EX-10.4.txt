a Delaware limited liability company

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.
i. Amendment. Pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Agreement, the Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
a. Section 4.4(e) of the Agreement is hereby amended to amend and restate the following in its entirety:
i. Indemnification by a Court. Notwithstanding any contrary determination made in any specific cause under Section 4.4(c), and notwithstanding the absence of any determination made thereunder, any Indemnitee may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Nevada for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 4.4(a) and 4.4(b). The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he, she or it has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 4.4(a) and 4.4(b). Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 4.4(c) nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the Indemnitee seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.4(e) shall be given to the Company promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.

i. Termination of Right to Carry Amounts.

1

the Termination Date (June 30, 2027) to the extent provided by the terms of the Management Services Agreement.
c. Section 11.4 of the Agreement is hereby amended to amend and restate the following in its entirety:
i. Cancellation of Certificate. Upon the completion of the distribution of Company assets as provided in Section 11.3, the Company shall be terminated and the person acting as Liquidator shall cause the cancellation of the Certificate and shall take such other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to terminate the Company, including filing the certificate of cancellation with the appropriate Secretary of State.
