WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, the Covered Persons are beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of GS Inc. (the “Common Stock”).

WHEREAS, GS Inc. entered into the Shareholders’ Agreement (hereinafter defined) in connection with the initial public offering of GS Inc. to address certain relationships among the parties thereto with respect to the voting and disposition of shares of Common Stock and various other matters, and to give to the Shareholders’ Committee (hereinafter defined) the power to enforce their agreements with respect thereto.

WHEREAS, the GS Inc. Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interests of GS Inc. to maintain the firm’s retention requirement applicable to Management Committee Members through a Board-level policy rather than through this Agreement.

WHEREAS, the Shareholders’ Committee and GS Inc. accordingly desire to amend the Shareholders’ Agreement to remove the transfer restrictions previously set forth in Section 2.1 thereof and to amend other provisions of the Shareholders’ Agreement to reflect such removal, in accordance with Section 7.2(h) thereof.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements, covenants and provisions herein contained, the parties hereto agree to amend and restate the Shareholders’ Agreement in its entirety as follows:
