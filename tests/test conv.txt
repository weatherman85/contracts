EXECUTION VERSION

CUSTODY AGREEMENT

This Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made as of November 3, 2021 (the “Effective Date”) between:

(1)
Apollo Debt Solutions BDC, a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, acting through its trustee Joseph D. Glatt (the “Client”); and
(2)
STATE STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, a bank and trust company organized under the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A. (the “Custodian”).
1
Definitions and Interpretation
Defined terms and the general rules of interpretation agreed by the Parties are set forth in Schedule 1.

2
Appointment of the Custodian
The Client hereby appoints the Custodian to provide the services set out in Sections 3 through 15 below (the “Services”) subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

3
Safekeeping Securities
3.1 Holding Securities.  The Custodian will hold Securities delivered or credited to its account under this Agreement directly or through accounts at Subcustodians or CSDs. In turn, Subcustodians will hold Securities directly or through accounts at CSDs.

3.2 Client Entitlements and Segregation. The Custodian will take the following steps to reflect the Client’s ownership of Securities and to separately identify the Securities of the Client from the proprietary assets of the Custodian, Subcustodians, and CSDs, in accordance with Local Market Practice: 

3.2.1 Accounts at the Custodian. Open and maintain on the records of the Custodian one or more securities accounts in the name of the Client or such other name as the Client may reasonably request (each, a “Securities Account”) and credit Securities to them;

3.2.2 Accounts at the Subcustodians or CSDs.  Open and maintain securities accounts at the Subcustodians or CSDs in which the Custodian is a direct participant, cause Subcustodians to open and maintain securities accounts at CSDs in which the Subcustodian is a participant, and cause Securities to be credited to the relevant accounts. Such accounts: (i) may be commingled (or omnibus) accounts for Securities of multiple customers of the Custodian (or Subcustodian, in the case of accounts opened by the Subcustodian at a CSD)  or, in limited markets, segregated (or separate) accounts for Securities of the Client; and (ii)  must not include any proprietary securities of the Custodian, the Subcustodian or the CSD;

3.2.3 Physical Securities. Physically segregate bearer Securities from the proprietary assets of the Custodian, and require that the Subcustodians physically segregate bearer Securities from the Subcustodian’s and the Custodian’s proprietary assets;

 



1

 

3.2.4 Registration Names.  Register certificated Securities (other than bearer securities) in the name of the Client or in the name of the Custodian, a Subcustodian, a CSD or a nominee of any of them, or otherwise in accordance with Local Market Practice and the laws and regulations applicable to the Custodian; and

3.2.5 Records of Transactions; Reconciliation. Maintain records of the Client’s transactions in the Securities Accounts and reconcile its records of clients’ securities holdings against the records of its Subcustodians and CSDs in which it is a direct participant in accordance with the Custodian’s standard procedures and Local Market Practice. Subcustodians will likewise maintain records of their client’s transactions and reconcile their records of the securities holdings of their clients against the records of the CSDs in which they are a direct participant in accordance with the Subcustodians’ standard procedures and Local Market Practice.

3.3 Securities Interchangeable. Securities of the Client (whether held in separate or commingled accounts) are fungible with all other securities of the same issue held in such accounts by the Custodian and its Subcustodians.  This means that the Client’s redelivery rights in respect of the Securities are not in respect of the Securities actually deposited with the Custodian or a Subcustodian from time to time, but rather in respect of Securities of the same number, class, denomination and issue as those Securities. 

3.4 Acceptance of Securities. Except as otherwise agreed in writing with the Client, the Custodian will only accept custody of Securities and other assets that it is operationally equipped and licensed to hold in the relevant market where it provides custodial services either directly or through an existing Subcustodian and may decline to accept custody of certain securities or asset types that it determines present an unacceptable risk profile or that it or its Subcustodians are not operationally equipped or permitted to hold under any law or regulation.

4
Cash
4.1 Cash Accounts. The Custodian will open and maintain in the name of the Client one or more cash deposit accounts (each a “Cash Account”) in such currencies as may be required in connection with the investment activity of the Client.  

4.2 Location of Cash Deposits. Cash received for the Client will be deposited with the Custodian, or with a Subcustodian, depending on the currency and/or the market. The Custodian will designate each currency in a particular market as On Book Cash or Off Book Cash. “On Book Cash” means the currency is maintained in a deposit account with, and recorded as a liability on the balance sheet of, the Custodian (through any of its branches) and “Off Book Cash” means the currency is maintained in a deposit account with, and recorded as a liability on the balance sheet of, a Subcustodian (through any of its branches).  The Custodian may change the designation of a currency as On Book or Off Book from time to time.  Clients will find the designation of currencies as On Book Cash and Off Book Cash, and any changes to such designations, in the Client Publications. 

4.3 Cash Records. The Custodian will reflect Cash balances held in all On Book and Off Book Client deposit accounts on its books and records and report the balances to the Client. 

4.4 Banking Relationship. In accepting deposits under this Agreement, the Custodian  (for On Book Cash) or the relevant Subcustodian (for Off Book Cash) acts as banker and does not hold the money deposited on trust or segregated from its proprietary assets. Accordingly, the Client is an unsecured creditor of the Custodian (for On Book Cash) or the relevant Subcustodian (for Off Book Cash), subject to such rights as may arise in an Insolvency Event as determined under the laws of the jurisdiction of 

 



2

 

the Custodian or relevant Subcustodian. With respect to Off Book Cash, the Custodian is only responsible for returning the actual amount that the Custodian receives from the Subcustodian.  

4.5 Interest and Charges. Cash Accounts may be interest bearing or non-interest bearing and may be subject to charges or fees on the deposit balance or on a per account basis. The Custodian or the relevant Subcustodian will determine on a periodic basis:

4.5.1 the interest rates, if any, (which may be positive, zero or negative) or equivalent charges or fees paid or charged to the Client from time to time with respect to a Cash Account; and 

4.5.2 the overdraft rates or equivalent charges or fees and the applicable overdraft thresholds (if any) that will trigger interest charges from time to time for overdrafts,

in each case, acting in their sole discretion, taking into account market conditions and other relevant commercial considerations. Interest and overdraft rates or other account charges or fees will vary by currency. Details on current rates and deposit account charges are available upon request.	

4.6 Overdrafts. The Client must maintain sufficient funds in the Cash Accounts to settle all transactions in the applicable currencies in a timely manner. The Custodian or its Subcustodians may, but are not required to, extend credit under this Agreement. The Custodian reserves the right to decline to process any Proper Instruction or settle any transaction that would result in an overdraft of the Cash Account. If an overdraft arises in the Cash Account, the Client agrees to repay the principal amount of the overdraft upon demand by the Custodian or within five Business Days, whichever is earlier, plus any applicable overdraft fees and interest on the principal overdraft.

5
Transaction Settlement
5.1 Settlement. The Custodian will settle all transactions in accordance with Local Market      Practice, which may not always be on a delivery-versus-payment or receipt-versus-payment basis. Except as otherwise provided below regarding Contractual Settlement, the Custodian will credit or debit the appropriate Cash Account on an actual settlement or payment basis. 

5.2 Contractual Settlement. In order to facilitate transaction settlement, the Custodian may provisionally credit settlement, maturity or redemption proceeds, or income, dividends and other distributions, on a contractual settlement or predetermined income basis (“Contractual Settlement”), for markets, securities and eligible clients as determined and notified by the Custodian in the Client Publications.  The Custodian can terminate or suspend Contractual Settlement for markets, securities or particular clients at any time.

5.3 Use of Funds. Where Contractual Settlement applies, the Custodian will credit or debit the appropriate Cash Account on the contractual settlement date or payable date for the relevant transaction. This means that (i) the Client will have use of the funds from the date that a sale was contracted to settle or the payable date, which may be earlier than the date payment actually occurs and (ii) the Custodian will have use of the funds debited from the Cash Account from the date that a purchase was contracted to settle until the date that settlement actually occurs.

5.4 Reversal.  The Custodian may reverse any Contractual Settlement credit at any time before actual receipt of the cash payment associated with the credit if the Custodian determines, in its reasonable judgement, that such payment will not be received within 30 days for that transaction or if the Custodian suspends or terminates the provision of Contractual Settlement for those Securities in that market. The Custodian will generally notify the Client two Business Days before any such reversal.

5.5 Secured Liability. To the extent that the Custodian has not received the cash payment associated with a credit, the amount credited remains a Secured Liability under this Agreement.

6
Corporate Actions 
6.1 Transmit Information. The Custodian will promptly transmit or make available to the Client all material written information customarily provided by a professional global custodian regarding an applicable Corporate Action, or a brief synopsis of that information, affecting Securities then being held under this Agreement, where (i) that information is received  directly from issuers of such Securities or from CSDs or Subcustodians or (ii) that information is publicly available in the relevant market from standard vendors routinely used by professional global custodians provided that the Custodian can verify the accuracy of such information.  The Custodian will transmit or make available such Corporate Action data it receives from primary sources (issuers, CSDs and Subcustodians) without further review although it will generally note if such information is single sourced. The Custodian generally will not transmit or make available such Corporate Action data it receives from secondary sources (vendors) unless the accuracy of that information can be verified against at least one additional source.

6.2 Exercise. The Custodian will process the Client’s elections with respect to any voluntary Corporate Action at the direction of the Client provided it has actual possession of the relevant Securities and it has received Proper Instructions by the deadline specified in the Custodian’s Corporate Action notification (“Corporate Actions Deadline Date”). The Custodian will use reasonable efforts to effect Proper Instructions received after that deadline but will have no responsibility for any failure to exercise such instructions accurately or timely. In the absence of receiving Proper Instructions by the Corporate Actions Deadline Date, the Custodian may take the default action specified in the corporate action notification. In the event of a mandatory Corporate Action, the Custodian will act without Proper Instructions in accordance with Section 22.10.  

6.3 Class Actions.  The Custodian will transmit written information received by the Custodian regarding any class action litigation to the extent set out in the Client Publications. The Custodian will not support class action participation by the Client beyond such forwarding of written information.  In no event will the Custodian act as a lead plaintiff in a class action. 

6.4 Fractional Positions. Fractional positions resulting from Corporate Actions will be dealt with in accordance with the Client Publications. 

7
Proxy Servicing
7.1 Transmit Information.  The Custodian will forward to the Client all proxies received by the Custodian relating to the Securities then held under this Agreement, for the markets designated in the Client Publications, unless otherwise instructed by the Client. The Custodian will use an agent to assist in the receipt and distribution of proxies and will share the Client’s position and contact information to facilitate such collection and distribution. 

7.2 Voting. The Custodian provides proxy voting services for the markets designated in the Client Publications. The Custodian will cause eligible proxies to be promptly executed by the registered holder in accordance with Proper Instructions and delivered to the issuer of the Securities or its designated agent.   In order for the Custodian to provide the voting services, the Custodian must have received such Proper Instructions, must have actual possession of the relevant Securities, and all requirements set out in the Client Publications must have been met, including where applicable receiving an executed power of attorney, in each case by the deadline specified in the Custodian’s proxy notification.

8
Income Collection
8.1 Monitoring and Crediting. The Custodian will use reasonable efforts to monitor and collect on a timely basis, in accordance with Local Market Practice, all income and other payments to which the Client is entitled in respect of the Securities held under this Agreement and Securities on loan through the securities lending program sponsored by the Custodian or its Affiliates.  The Custodian will credit such amounts to the Cash Account of the Client as received, except where Contractual Settlement applies. 

8.2 Repatriation of Income.  The Client is responsible for directing the repatriation of income into the base currency of the Portfolio or another currency selected by the Client, and may enter into separate arrangements to do so, as set out in Section 13 of this Agreement.

9
Statements and Reports
9.1 Contents. The Custodian will make available reports to the Client regarding the Portfolio on a periodic basis as selected by the Client from certain online tools made available from time to time by the Custodian or as otherwise agreed with the Client. The reports will include Cash balances, an itemized statement of Securities and Cash and Securities transaction activity.  Market values contained in these reports are unaudited and based on the Custodian’s standard pricing vendors and practices. These reports will not include net asset value calculations.

9.2 Cash and Securities Not Held. The Custodian may agree to incorporate information in respect of cash or securities not held by the Custodian. In making available such information to the Client, the Custodian will rely upon the information provided by the Client or a third party without any requirement to verify the accuracy of such information.  The Custodian will not perform any other Services in relation to such cash or securities.

10
Tax Withholding and Tax Relief
10.1 Withholding. The Custodian will withhold (or cause to be withheld) the amount of any tax which is required to be withheld by the Custodian or Subcustodian under the Law applicable to the Custodian or Subcustodian based on the Client’s domicile and entity type in respect of any dividend, interest income or other distribution in relation to any Security, and/or the proceeds or income from the sale or other transfer of any Security held by the Custodian.  If the Client has not provided the requisite information and documentation, the Custodian is obligated to arrange for maximum withholding. In certain markets, the Client will be required to hire a local tax agent to calculate withholding, as set out in the Client Publications.

10.2 Tax Relief. The Custodian will apply for a reduction of withholding tax and refund of any tax paid or tax credits in respect of income payments on Securities based on the Client’s entitlement under relevant tax treaties or laws which apply in each market that supports a standard tax reclaim process, in all cases as may be set out from time to time in the Client Publications. The Custodian does not facilitate tax reclaims for tax transparent or pass-through (i.e., multiple-beneficiary) entities such as partnerships, LLCs, common trusts or any other types of entities that are generally ineligible for tax treaty or domestic law tax entitlements, even where the partners or beneficial holders of such entities may be eligible.  

10.3 Documentation.  In order for the Custodian to perform the services in this Section 10, the Client will provide the Custodian such information and documentation as may be required from time to time by the Custodian for tax purposes, including documentary evidence of its tax domicile, and its entity type and details of any special ruling or treatment to which the Client may be entitled in relation to 

 



5

 

countries where the Client engages or  proposes to engage in investment activity or where Securities are or will be held. The Client is responsible for ensuring the documentation and information provided is true and accurate in all material respects and will promptly provide the Custodian with all necessary corrections or updates upon becoming aware of any changes or inaccuracies in the documentation or information supplied. The provision of documentation and information under this Section 10.3 will be taken to be a Proper Instruction upon which the Custodian will be entitled to rely for all purposes under this Section 10, including calculating withholding and determining available tax relief, without the need to undertake any further inquiries or verification. 

10.4 Client Responsible for Taxes. The Client will be liable for all taxes, levies or similar obligations which arise as a result of the Client’s investment activity, including in relation to any Cash or Securities held by the Custodian on behalf of the Client, or any related transactions. If any taxes become payable in relation to any prior payment made to the Client by the Custodian, the Custodian may withhold any credit balance in the Client’s Cash Accounts to the extent necessary to satisfy such tax obligation. The Client will also remain liable for any tax deficiency.

10.5 No Tax Advice. The Client acknowledges that the Custodian is not, and will not be deemed to be, providing tax advice or tax counsel.

11
Physical Safekeeping of Investment Documents 
11.1 Document Safekeeping. The Custodian may agree to provide physical safekeeping for Investment Documents delivered to it  and will return such Investment Documents to the Client upon receipt of Proper Instructions, subject to additional documentation and other requirements as the Custodian may specify from time to time. 

11.2 No Other Services. The Custodian will not otherwise perform any other Services in relation to such Investment Documents.

12
Alternative Asset Servicing
12.1 Alternative Assets. The Custodian may agree to reflect the Client’s Alternative Assets on its books, records or statements. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Custodian will not perform any other services or assume any obligations in relation to Alternative Assets. The Custodian may, in limited cases, agree to register the Client’s interests in Alternative Assets in the name of the Custodian, subject to additional documentation and other requirements as the Custodian may specify from time to time.  

13
Foreign Exchange 
13.1 Role of Custodian. The role of the Custodian with respect to foreign exchange transactions is limited to facilitating the processing and settlement of such transactions. The Custodian does not have any agency, trust or fiduciary obligation to the Client or any other person in connection with the execution of any foreign exchange transactions, other than the obligation as agent to process the Proper Instructions given by the Client.

13.2 Role of Counterparties. If the Client enters into any foreign exchange transaction with State Street Bank and Trust Company, a Subcustodian or any of their Affiliates, the Client does so on the basis that these entities are acting as a principal dealer and counterparty, and not as fiduciary or agent to the Client, and the execution services are governed by separate arrangements (including pricing) and do not form part of the Services provided by the Custodian under this Agreement. This applies to foreign exchange transactions entered into by the Client directly with the trading desk of these entities 

 



6

 

or by Proper Instruction to the Custodian using the indirect foreign exchange services described in the Client Publications.

At the request of the Client, the Custodian may agree to appoint one or more qualified banks, trust companies or other entities designated by the Client to act as a subcustodian (each a “Special Subcustodian”)  for purposes specified by the Client.  In connection with the appointment of a Special Subcustodian, the Custodian shall enter into a tri-party subcustodian agreement with the Special Subcustodian and the Client in form and substance approved the Custodian, provided that such agreement shall comply with Law applicable to the Client and shall be consistent with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, to the extent practicable.

14.4. Provisions Relating to Rule 17f-5 

14.4.1 Delegation.  Each Client, by resolution of its Board, delegates to the Custodian, pursuant to Rule 17f-5(b), the obligations to perform as the Client’s Foreign Custody Manager and, unless the Custodian advises the Customer that it does not accept such delegation with respect to a country, the Custodian accepts such delegation.  The Custodian acting in this capacity shall be referred to as the “Foreign Custody Manager.”

14.4.2 Exercise of Care as Foreign Custody Manager.

14.4.4 Scope of Delegated Responsibilities.  The Foreign Custody Manager, when placing and maintaining Foreign Assets in the care of an Eligible Foreign Custodian, will determine that: (i) the Foreign Assets will be subject to reasonable care, based on the standards applicable to custodians in the country in which the Foreign Assets will be held by the Eligible Foreign Custodian, after considering all factors relevant to the safekeeping of such assets, including, without limitation the factors specified in Rule 17f-5(c)(1), and (ii) the contract between the Foreign Custody Manager and the Eligible Foreign Custodian governing the foreign custody arrangements will satisfy the requirements of Rule 17f-5(c)(2).  The Foreign Custody Manager will establish a system to monitor (a) the appropriateness of maintaining the 

 



7

 

Foreign Assets with the Eligible Foreign Custodian, and (b) the performance of the contract governing the foreign custody arrangements.  The Foreign Custody Manager will notify the Client if it determines that the custody arrangements with an Eligible Foreign Custodian are no longer appropriate and will act in accordance with the Client’s Proper Instructions with respect to the disposition of the affected Foreign Assets.

14.4.5 Reporting Requirements.  The Foreign Custody Manager will (i) report the withdrawal of Foreign Assets from an Eligible Foreign Custodian and the placement of Foreign Assets with another Eligible Foreign Custodian by providing to the Client an updated Schedule A at the end of the calendar quarter in which the action has occurred, and (ii) after the occurrence of any other material change in the foreign custody arrangements of the Client, make a written report available to the Client containing a notification of the change. 

14.4.6 Representations of Foreign Custody Manager and Client. The Foreign Custody Manager represents to Client that it is a U.S. Bank as defined in Section (a)(7) of Rule 17f-5(a)(7).  Client represents to the Custodian that its Board has (i) determined that it is reasonable for the Board to rely on the Custodian to perform the responsibilities delegated pursuant to this Agreement to the Custodian as the Foreign Custody Manager of the Client, and (ii) considered and determined to accept the risk described in the first sentence of Section 18.2 as is incurred by placing and maintaining the Client’s Foreign Assets in each Covered Foreign Country.

14.4.7. Withdrawal of Acceptance of Delegation as Foreign Custody Manager.  Upon reasonable prior written notice to the Client, the Foreign Custody Manager may withdraw its acceptance of such delegated responsibilities generally or with respect to a specified Covered Foreign Country, and the Custodian will have no further responsibility in its capacity as Foreign Custody Manager to the Client generally or with respect to the designated Covered Foreign Country, as applicable.

14.4.8. Settlement Practices.  The Custodian will provide to each Client the information with respect to custody and settlement practices in countries in which the Custodian employs an Eligible Foreign Custodian described on Schedule C at the time or times set out on the Schedule.

15
Central Securities Depositories

The Custodian will have the right, without prior notice to or the consent of the Client, to employ Delegates to provide or assist it in the provision of any part of the Services other than Services required by Law applicable to either Party to be performed by a qualified custodian or CSD. Unless otherwise agreed in a fee schedule, the Custodian will be responsible for the compensation of its Delegates. 

16.2 Provision of Information Regarding Delegates. The Custodian will provide or make available to the Client on a quarterly or other periodic basis information regarding its global operating model for the delivery of the Services, which information will include the identities of Delegates affiliated with the Custodian that perform or may perform any part of the Services, and the locations from which such Delegates perform Services, as well as such other information about its Delegates as the Client may reasonably request from time to time.  

16.3 Third Parties. Nothing in this Section limits or restricts the Custodian’s right to use Affiliates or third parties to perform or discharge, or assist it in the performance or discharge of, any obligations or duties under this Agreement other than the provision of the Services. 

17
Standard of Care and Liability 
17.1 Standard of Care.

The parties agree that “negligence” will mean a breach by the Custodian of its obligation to exercise the standard of care described in Section 17.1 above. 

17.3 Responsibility for Subcustodians. The Custodian will be liable to the Client for the acts and omissions of its Subcustodians as if it had committed such acts and omissions itself; provided that:

17.4 Responsibility for Special Subcustodians. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 17.3 to the contrary, the Custodian shall not be liable to the Client for Losses suffered or incurred by the Client resulting from the acts or omissions of a Special Subcustodian, except to the extent such Losses are caused by the negligence, wilful default or fraud of the Custodian.  In the event of any such Loss, the Custodian shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce such rights as it may have against any Special Subcustodian.

17.5 Responsibility for Delegates. The Custodian will be liable to the Client for the acts and omissions of its Delegates as if it had committed such acts and omissions itself.

18
Error Correction
18.1 Error Correction.  If an error results from an act or omission of the Custodian in performing the services under this Agreement, the Custodian may take such remedial action as it considers appropriate under the circumstances, which may include effecting corrective transactions involving the Client’s assets, where and to the extent reasonably necessary to place the Client in the position (or its equivalent) it would have been had the error not occurred.  The Custodian will be responsible for Losses arising from its errors in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and will be entitled to retain gains arising from its errors or related remedial actions unless otherwise prohibited by Law.  Where an error results in a series of related Losses and gains, the Custodian will be entitled to net gains against Losses

Indemnity
20.1 Indemnity by Client. Subject to this Section 20 and the exclusions and limitations of liability elsewhere in this Agreement, including Section 17.8, the Client will indemnify the Custodian against any direct Losses incurred by the Custodian (including Losses incurred by Subcustodians or Delegates for which the Custodian is liable) in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement, including acting on Proper Instructions and Losses incurred by virtue of being the holder of record of the Client’s Securities,  except, in each case, to the extent such Losses result from the Custodian’s 

 



11

 

negligence, wilful default or fraud (or that of its Subcustodians or Delegates) in the discharge of the Custodian’s duties under this Agreement.

20.2 Indemnity by Custodian. Subject to this Section 20 and the exclusions and limitations of liability elsewhere in this Agreement, including Section 17.7 and 17.8, the Custodian will indemnify the Client against any direct Losses incurred by the Client, in each case, to the extent such Losses result from the negligence, wilful default or fraud of the Custodian (or that of its Subcustodians or Delegates) in the discharge of the Custodian’s duties under this Agreement.

20.3 Duty to Mitigate. Each Party will use reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses in respect of which it claims indemnification under this Agreement. 

20.4 Notice of Claims. A Party seeking indemnification under this Section (“Indemnified Party”) against a third-party claim (“Indemnified Claim”) will promptly provide written notice of such claim to the Party obligated to indemnify (“Indemnifying Party”). The failure to notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve such Party of any liability under this Section, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the investigation and/or defense of the Indemnified Claim.  

20.5 Right to Control Third Party Claims. The Indemnifying Party will, at its own expense, be entitled but not obligated to control and direct the investigation and defense of any Indemnified Claim, except where the Custodian is the Indemnified Party and is seeking indemnification from multiple customers for claims based on common facts or otherwise related to the Indemnified Claim, in which case the Custodian will have the right to control and direct the investigation and defense of such claim, at the expense of (i) the Indemnifying Party or (ii) all of the customers from which indemnification is sought, including the Indemnifying Party, pro rata, as appropriate.  Where the Indemnifying Party controls and directs the investigation of the defence of the Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel at its own expense. If a conflict of interest exists between the Parties with respect to the defense of such claim, the reasonable cost of separate counsel will be an indemnified expense.

20.6 Settlement of Claims.  Neither Party may settle an Indemnified Claim without the consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided that the Indemnifying Party will have the right to settle an Indemnified Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party if such settlement:

20.6.1 involves only the payment of money; 

20.6.2 fully and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party from any liability in exchange for the amount paid in settlement; and 

20.6.3 does not include any admission of fault or liability in relation to the Indemnified Party.  

20.7 Cooperation.  In all cases, each Party will, as applicable, provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to the other Party and keep the other Party apprised as to the status of the Indemnified Claim, including any discussions relating to the settlement of the claim and the details of any settlement offer.

21

21.6 Fees.  In consideration for the Services provided by the Custodian, the Client will pay the Fees as agreed in a written fee schedule or otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties from time to time.

The Custodian may rely upon the authority of each Authorized Person until it receives written notice to the contrary from the Client and has had a reasonable time to act on such notice.

22.3 Authentication Procedures. The Custodian will implement Authentication Procedures.  The Client acknowledges that the Authentication Procedures are intended to provide a commercially reasonable degree of protection against unauthorized transactions of certain types and are not designed to detect errors.  Any purported Proper Instruction received by the Custodian in accordance 

 



13

 

with an Authentication Procedure will be taken to have originated from an Authorized Person and will constitute a Proper Instruction under this Agreement for all purposes. 

22.4 Security Measures by Client. The Client is responsible for ensuring that appropriate security measures are implemented to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of any Authentication Procedure made available to it or an Investment Manager in connection with this Agreement.

22.5 No Duty to Verify.

22.6 Decline/Delay in Processing. The Custodian reserves the right to decline to process or delay the processing of any purported Proper Instruction where: 

22.6.1 the Custodian, in good faith, determines that the instruction may not have been properly authorized; 

22.6.2 the instruction is inaccurate, incomplete or unclear; 

22.6.3 the instruction conflicts with the terms of this Agreement or any Law applicable to either Party, Local Market Practice or the Custodian’s standard operating procedures; or

In these circumstances, the Custodian will promptly seek authentication, clarification, correction or amendment of any Proper Instruction, as the case may be.

22.9 Conflicting Claims. If there is a dispute or conflicting claim with respect to Securities or Cash held by the Custodian under this Agreement, the Custodian is entitled to refuse to act on a Proper Instruction of the Client or any Investment Manager in relation to the particular Securities or Cash until either (i) the dispute or conflicting claims have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or settled by agreement between the conflicting parties, and the Custodian has received written evidence satisfactory to it of such determination or agreement, or (ii) the Custodian has received an indemnity, security or both, satisfactory to it and sufficient to hold it harmless from and against any and all Losses which the Custodian may incur as a result of its actions.  

 



14

 

22.10 Matters Not Requiring Proper Instructions. The Client authorises the Custodian in the absence of Proper Instructions to attend to all matters which may be necessary or appropriate to discharge its duties and give effect to the terms of this Agreement, including the execution, in the Client’s name or on its behalf, of any affidavits, certificates of ownership and other certificates and documents relating to Securities.

Creditors Rights
23.1 Security. To secure the full and timely satisfaction of all Secured Liabilities, the Client hereby grants to the Custodian a security interest in and a right of retention, sale and set off, as applicable, against (i) all of the Client’s Cash, Securities, and other assets, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, in the possession or under the control of the Custodian or its Subcustodians pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) any and all cash proceeds of any of the above (collectively, the “Collateral”).

23.2 Rights of the Custodian. In the event that the Client fails to satisfy in full any of the Secured Liabilities as and when due and payable, the Custodian will have, in addition to all other rights and remedies arising under this Agreement or under applicable Law, the rights and remedies of a secured party under applicable Law.   Without prejudice to the Custodian’s other rights and remedies, the Custodian will be entitled, in each case as and to the extent reasonably necessary to satisfy in full the Secured Liabilities and any related transaction expenses, to (a) exercise its right of retention and withhold delivery of any Collateral and otherwise refuse to act on any Proper Instruction relating to such Collateral, (b) sell or otherwise realize any Collateral, and (c) set off the net proceeds of such sale or realization of Collateral and/or the amount of any deposit balances standing to the credit of the Client in any Cash Account(s) against such Secured Liabilities.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Client acknowledges that it will be commercially reasonable for the Custodian to, among other things: (i) accelerate or cause the acceleration of the maturity of any fixed term deposits comprised in the Collateral and (ii) effect any necessary currency conversions through its own trading desk at such exchange rates as it determines in its reasonable discretion, which rates may include a mark-up from the rates the Custodian receives on the interbank market.  

23.4 Notice. The Custodian will use reasonable efforts to give the Client prior notice of any exercise of the right to sell or otherwise realize Collateral set forth above, provided that the Custodian will not be obligated to give prior notice to the Client or delay exercising its rights pending or after the provision of such notice if, in its reasonable judgment, giving such notice or any such delay would prejudice its ability to obtain satisfaction in full of the Secured Liabilities.

24
Confidentiality and Use of Data

24.2.2 Use of Data for Indicators. The Custodian and its Affiliates may use Data to develop, publish or otherwise distribute to third parties certain investor behavior “indicators” or “indices” that represent broad trends in the flow of investment funds into various markets, sectors or investment instruments (collectively, the “Indicators”), but only so long as (i) the Data is combined or aggregated with (A) information relating to other customers of the Custodian and/or (B) information derived from other sources, in each case such that the Indicators do not allow for attribution to or identification of such Data with the Client, (ii) the Data represents less than a statistically meaningful portion of all of the data used to create the Indicators and (iii) the Custodian publishes or otherwise distributes to third parties only the Indicators and under no circumstance publishes, makes available, distributes or otherwise discloses any of the Data to any third party, whether aggregated, anonymized or otherwise, except as expressly permitted under this Agreement.

24.3 Disclosure of Confidential Information and Data 

24.3.1 Disclosure of Confidential Information to Representatives. The Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information without the Disclosing Party’s consent to its attorneys, accountants, auditors, consultants and other similar advisors that have a reasonable need to know such Confidential Information (“Representatives”), provided such Confidential Information is disclosed under obligations of confidentiality that prohibit the disclosure or use of such Confidential Information by the Representatives for any purpose other than the specific engagement with the Receiving Party for which the Representative has been retained and that are otherwise no less restrictive than the confidentiality obligations contained in this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that use of Confidential Information by a Representative to represent its other clients in dealing with the Disclosing Party would constitute a breach of this Section 24.3.  Where the Custodian is the Receiving Party, “Representatives” will include its Affiliates and Service Providers (as defined below). 

24.3.2 Disclosure and Use of Confidential Information by Custodian. The Custodian may disclose and permit use (as applicable) of Confidential Information of the Client without the Client’s consent:

24.3.2.2 to its Affiliates in connection with the management of the businesses of the Custodian and its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, financial and operational management and reporting, risk management, legal and regulatory compliance and client service management and marketing.

24.3.3 Confidential Information and Cloud Computing and Storage.

The Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to the extent such disclosure is required to satisfy any legal requirement (including in response to court-issued orders, investigative demands, subpoenas or similar processes or to satisfy the requirements of any applicable regulatory authority). 

24.3.5 Harm of Unauthorized Disclosure of Confidential Information. Each Party acknowledges that the disclosure to any non-authorized third party of Confidential Information or the use of Confidential Information in breach of this Agreement, may immediately give rise to continuing irreparable injury inadequately compensable in damages at law, and in such cases the Receiving Party agrees to waive any defense that an adequate remedy at law is available if the Disclosing Party seeks to obtain injunctive relief against any such breach or any threatened breach.  

24.3.6 Responsibility for Representatives. Each Party will be responsible for any use or disclosure of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in breach of this Agreement by its Representatives as though such Party had used or disclosed such Confidential Information itself.  

24.3.7 No Disclosure to Custodian Asset Manager Division. In no event will the Custodian allow representatives of its asset management division or Affiliates engaged in asset management to have access to or to use Confidential Information of the Client, including Data.

29.5 Sole Remedy. Subject to the right to seek relief under the specific circumstances expressly permitted in this Agreement, each of the Custodian and the Client agrees that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, a claim for breach of contract under and consistent with the terms of this Agreement will be the sole and exclusive remedy available for any and all matters arising from or in any way relating to this Agreement, the provision of the Services or any conduct (including omissions and alleged conduct) relating to the Agreement or provision of the Services, whether before, during or after the term of this Agreement.
