“Adjusted Daily Simple RFR” means, with respect to any RFR Borrowing denominated in Sterling, an interest rate per annum equal to (a) the Daily Simple RFR, plus (b) 0.0326%, provided that if the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR as so determined would be less than the Floor, such rate shall be deemed to be equal to the Floor for the purposes of calculating such rate.

“Adjusted EURIBOR Rate” means the EURIBOR Rate, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities; provided that if the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate as so determined would be less than the Floor, such rate shall be deemed to be equal to the Floor for the purposes of calculating such rate.

“Adjusted Gross Borrowing Base” means the Gross Borrowing Base plus the amount of any cash held in a “collection” (or similar) account of any Excluded Asset that is a “collateralized loan obligation” (a “CLO”) or is otherwise subject to a third-party financing whereby a trustee or similar third party administers the “collection” (or similar) account and periodic “waterfall” payments therefrom, in each case, that is reflected on a “payment date schedule” (or similar distribution statement and, in each case, which may be a draft so long as the amount to be distributed has been finalized) to be (subject only to the lapse of time for a period not to exceed 30 days from the date of such schedule or statement) irrevocably distributed, directly or indirectly, to an Obligor on the next payment date or similar distribution date for such CLO or other Excluded Asset.

“Adjusted Term SOFR Rate” means, with respect to any Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum equal to the 

1

The outstanding utilized notional amount of any total return swap and the notional amount of any Credit Default Swap where an Obligor is a protection seller, in each case, less the value of the margin posted by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder at such time shall be treated as a Senior Security of the Borrower for the purposes of calculating the Asset Coverage Ratio.

“Benchmark” means, initially, with respect to any Loan in any Currency, the applicable Relevant Rate for such Currency; provided that if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred with respect to the applicable Relevant Rate or the then-current Benchmark for such Currency, then “Benchmark” for such Currency means the applicable Benchmark Replacement to the extent that such Benchmark Replacement has replaced such prior benchmark rate pursuant to clause (b) or clause (c) of Section 2.13.

 

“Benchmark Replacement” means, for any Available Tenor, the first alternative set forth in the order below that can be determined by the Administrative Agent for the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date; provided that, in the case of any Loan denominated in a Currency other than Dollars, “Benchmark Replacement” shall mean the alternative set forth in (2) below:

 

(1) the sum of: (a) Daily Simple SOFR and (b) 0.10%, or

 

(2)  the sum of: (a) the alternate benchmark rate that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower as the replacement for the then-current Benchmark for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a replacement benchmark rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention in 

6

 

the United States for determining a benchmark rate as a replacement for the then-current Benchmark for syndicated credit facilities denominated in the applicable Currency at such time and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment;

 

If the Benchmark Replacement as determined pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above would be less than the Floor, the Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to be the Floor for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

“Benchmark Replacement Adjustment” means, with respect to any replacement of the then-current Benchmark with an Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for any applicable Interest Period and Available Tenor for any setting of such Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement, the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body on the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date and/or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for syndicated credit facilities denominated in the applicable Currency in the U.S. syndicated loan market at such time.

 

“Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes” means, with respect to the use or administration of any Benchmark Replacement, any technical, administrative or operational changes (including changes to the definition of “Alternate Base Rate,” the definition of “Business Day,” the definition of “Interest Period,” timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest, timing of borrowing requests or prepayment, conversion or continuation notices, length of lookback periods, the applicability of breakage provisions, and other technical, administrative or operational matters) that the Administrative Agent decides may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation of such Benchmark Replacement and to permit the administration thereof by the Administrative Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market practice and substantially consistent with conforming changes made in other syndicated credit facilities for which JPMCB acts as administrative agent (or, if the Administrative Agent decides that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines that no market practice for the administration of such Benchmark Replacement exists, in such other manner of administration as the Administrative Agent decides is reasonably necessary in connection with the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents).

 

“Benchmark Replacement Date” means, with respect to any Benchmark, the earliest to occur of the following events with respect to such then-current Benchmark:

 

(1) in the case of clause (1) or (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the later of (a) the date of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein and (b) the date on which the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published 

7

 

component used in the calculation thereof) permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or

 

(2) in the case of clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the first date on which such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been determined and announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) to be no longer representative; provided, that such non-representativeness will be determined by reference to the most recent statement or publication referenced in such clause (3) and even if any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the event giving rise to the Benchmark Replacement Date occurs on the same day as, but earlier than, the Reference Time in respect of any determination, the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Reference Time for such determination and (ii) the “Benchmark Replacement Date” will be deemed to have occurred in the case of clause (1) or (2) with respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set forth therein with respect to all then-current Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof).

 

“Benchmark Transition Event” means, with respect to any Benchmark, the occurrence of one or more of the following events with respect to such then-current Benchmark:

(1)	a public statement or publication of information by or on behalf of the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof), permanently or indefinitely, provided that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof);

(2)	a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof), the Federal Reserve Board, the NYFRB, the CME Term SOFR Administrator (solely in the case of the Term SOFR Reference Rate), the central bank for the Currency applicable to such Benchmark, an insolvency official with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), a resolution authority with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component) or a court or an entity with similar insolvency or resolution authority over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), in each case, which states that the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component) has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) permanently or indefinitely; provided that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or

(3)	a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) or the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) announcing that all 

8

Loans and Borrowings may also be identified by Currency.

SECTION 1.03.	Terms Generally.  The definitions of terms herein shall apply equally to the singular and plural forms of the terms defined.  Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms.  The words “include”, “includes” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase “without limitation”.  The word “will” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word 

53

 

“shall”.  Unless the context requires otherwise (a) any definition of or reference to any agreement, instrument or other document herein shall be construed as referring to such agreement, instrument or other document as from time to time amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented, renewed or otherwise modified (subject to any restrictions on such amendments, supplements, renewals or modifications set forth herein or therein), (b) any reference herein to any Person shall be construed to include such Person’s successors and assigns, (c) the words “herein”, “hereof” and “hereunder”, and words of similar import, shall be construed to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any particular provision hereof, (d) all references herein to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules shall be construed to refer to Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement and (e) the words “asset” and “property” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect and to refer to any and all tangible and intangible assets and properties, including cash, securities, accounts and contract rights.  For the avoidance of doubt, any cash payment (other than any cash payment on account of interest or expenses or fractional shares) made by the Borrower in respect of any conversion features in any convertible securities shall constitute a “regularly scheduled payment, prepayment or redemption of principal and interest” within the meaning of clause (a) of Section 6.12.  Solely for purposes of this Agreement, any references to “principal amount” or “obligations” owed by any Person under any (x) Hedging Agreement (other than a total return swap) shall refer to the amount that would be required to be paid by such Person if such Hedging Agreement were terminated at such time (after giving effect to any netting agreement) less any collateral posted in support thereof and (y) total return swap shall refer to the notional amount thereof less any collateral posted in support thereof.   

SECTION 1.04.	Accounting Terms; GAAP.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature shall be construed in accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time; provided that, if the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that the Borrower requests an amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the Effective Date in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith.  The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree to enter into negotiations in good faith in order to amend such provisions of this Agreement so as to equitably reflect such change to comply with GAAP with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the Borrower’s financial condition shall be the same after such change to comply with GAAP as if such change had not been made.  The Borrower covenants and agrees with the Lenders that whether or not the Borrower may at any time adopt Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification 820 or 825-10 (or, in each case, any other Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) or accounts for liabilities acquired in an acquisition on a fair value basis pursuant to Financial Accounting Standard No. 141(R) (or successor standard solely as it relates to fair valuing liabilities), all determinations of compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be made on the basis that the Borrower has not adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification 820 or 825-10 (or, in each case, any other Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) or, in the case of liabilities 

54

 

acquired in an acquisition, Financial Accounting Standard No. 141(R) (or such successor standard solely as it relates to fair valuing liabilities).

SECTION 1.05.	Currencies; Currency Equivalents.

(a)	Currencies Generally.  At any time, any reference in the definition of the term “Agreed Foreign Currency” or in any other provision of this Agreement to the Currency of any particular nation means the lawful currency of such nation at such time whether or not the name of such Currency is the same as it was on the Effective Date.  Except as provided in Section 2.10(b) and the last sentence of Section 2.18(a), for purposes of determining (i) whether the amount of any Borrowing or Letter of Credit under the Multicurrency Commitments, together with all other Borrowings and Letters of Credit under the Multicurrency Commitments then outstanding or to be borrowed at the same time as such Borrowing, would exceed the aggregate amount of such Multicurrency Commitments, (ii) the aggregate unutilized amount of the Multicurrency Commitments, (iii) the Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure, (iv) the Multicurrency LC Exposure, (v) the Covered Debt Amount and (vi) the Borrowing Base or the Value of any Portfolio Investment, the outstanding principal amount of any Borrowing or Letter of Credit that is denominated in any Foreign Currency or the Value of any Portfolio Investment that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the Foreign Currency of such Borrowing, Letter of Credit or Portfolio Investment, as the case may be, determined as of the date of such Borrowing or Letter of Credit (determined in accordance with the last sentence of the definition of the term “Interest Period”) or the date of valuation of such Portfolio Investment, as the case may be; provided that in connection with the delivery of any Borrowing Base Certificate pursuant to Section 5.01(d) or (e), such amounts shall be determined as of the date of delivery of such Borrowing Base Certificate.  

(b)	Special Provisions Relating to Euro.  Each obligation hereunder of any party hereto that is denominated in the National Currency of a state that is not a Participating Member State on the Effective Date shall, effective from the date on which such state becomes a Participating Member State, be redenominated in Euro in accordance with the legislation of the European Union applicable to the European Monetary Union; provided that, if and to the extent that any such legislation provides that any such obligation of any such party payable within such Participating Member State by crediting an account of the creditor can be paid by the debtor either in Euros or such National Currency, such party shall be entitled to pay or repay such amount either in Euros or in such National Currency.  If the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in this Agreement with respect to an Agreed Foreign Currency of any country that becomes a Participating Member State after the date on which such currency becomes an Agreed Foreign Currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the Euro, such convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis effective as of and from the date on which such state becomes a Participating Member State; provided that, with respect to any Borrowing denominated in such currency that is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect at the end of the Interest Period therefor.

Without prejudice to the respective liabilities of the Borrower to the Lenders and the Lenders to the Borrower under or pursuant to this Agreement, each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative 

55

 

Agent may from time to time, in consultation with the Borrower, reasonably specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction or changeover to the Euro in any country that becomes a Participating Member State after the Effective Date; provided that the Administrative Agent shall provide the Borrower and the Lenders with prior notice of the proposed change with an explanation of such change in sufficient time to permit the Borrower and the Lenders an opportunity to respond to such proposed change.

(c)	Exchange Rates; Currency Equivalents.  The Administrative Agent shall determine the Exchange Rate for any Foreign Currency as of each Revaluation Date to be used for calculating the Dollar Equivalent amounts of Loans, Letters of Credit and Revolving Credit Exposure denominated in such Foreign Currency. Such Exchange Rate shall become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Exchange Rate employed in converting any amounts between the applicable currencies until the next Revaluation Date to occur. Except for purposes of financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount as so determined by the Administrative Agent.  Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing, conversion, continuation or prepayment of a Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing, Term Benchmark Loan, RFR Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Foreign Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Agreed Foreign Currency, with 0.5 of a unit being rounded upward).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of determining compliance with any basket in this Agreement, in no event shall any Obligor be deemed not to be in compliance with any such basket solely as a result of a change in Exchange Rates.

SECTION 1.06.	Divisions.  For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized or acquired on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time. 

SECTION 1.07.	Outstanding Indebtedness.  To the extent that any Indebtedness, that is otherwise permitted to be repaid pursuant to Section 6.12 is defeased on terms customary for senior unsecured notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act for a period not to exceed more than sixty (60) days (or such longer period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its sole discretion) and in accordance with the terms of the documentation governing such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness shall be deemed not to be outstanding for purposes of Section 6.01 and the definition of “Covered Debt Amount” to the extent of the amount of such defeasance.

SECTION 1.08.	Interest Rates; Benchmark Notification.  The interest rate on a Loan denominated in dollars or an Agreed Foreign Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the future become, the subject of 

56

 

regulatory reform.  Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Section 2.15(b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest.  The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the existing interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did any existing interest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.  The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any  interest rate used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

(a)	Obligations of Lenders.  Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Class, Currency and Type made by the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments of the same Class.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required.

(b)	Type of Loans.

Each Lender at its option may make any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that (x) any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (y) in exercising such option, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to minimize any increased costs to the Borrower resulting therefrom (which obligation of the Lender shall not require it to take, or refrain from taking, actions that it determines would result in increased costs for which it will not be compensated hereunder or that it determines would be otherwise disadvantageous to it and in the event of such request for costs for which compensation is provided under this Agreement, the provisions of Section 2.15 shall apply).

(c)	Minimum Amounts.  Each Borrowing (whether Term Benchmark, RFR, Swingline or ABR) shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, with respect to any Agreed Foreign Currency, such smaller minimum amount as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent; provided that a Borrowing of a Class may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unutilized balance of the total Commitments of such Class or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement of such Class as contemplated by Section 2.05(f).  Borrowings of more than one Class, Currency and Type may be outstanding at the same time.

(d)	Limitations on Interest Periods.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request (or to elect to convert to or continue as a Term Benchmark Borrowing) any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested therefor would end after the Maturity Date.

If no election as to the Currency of a Borrowing is specified in a Borrowing Request, then the requested Borrowing shall be denominated in Dollars.  If no election as to the Type of a Borrowing is specified in a Borrowing Request, then the requested Borrowing shall be a Term Benchmark Borrowing having an Interest Period of one month and if an Agreed Foreign Currency has been specified, the requested Borrowing shall be a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in such Agreed Foreign Currency having an Interest Period of one month; provided, however, if the specified Foreign

SECTION 2.04.	Swingline Loans.

(a)	Agreement to Make Swingline Loans.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Swingline Lender severally agrees to make Swingline Loans under (x) the Multicurrency Commitment in the case of each Multicurrency Swingline Lender or (y) the Dollar Commitment in the case of each Dollar Swingline Lender, in each case, to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period, in Dollars and in AUD, CAD, Euros and Sterling in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $60,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be permitted after giving effect to the application of the other sub-clauses of this clause (a)), (ii) (x) the sum of any Multicurrency Swingline Lender’s outstanding Syndicated Multicurrency Loans, its Multicurrency LC Exposure, its outstanding Swingline Loans and (without duplication) its other Multicurrency Swingline Exposure exceeding its Multicurrency Commitment or (y) the sum of any Dollar Swingline Lender’s outstanding Syndicated Dollar Loans, its Dollar LC Exposure, its outstanding Swingline Loans and (without duplication) its other Dollar Swingline Exposure exceeding its Dollar Commitment; (iii) the total Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures exceeding the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments or the total Revolving Dollar Credit Exposures exceeding the aggregate Dollar Commitments, (iv) the total Covered Debt Amount exceeding the Borrowing Base then in effect; provided that no Swingline Lender shall be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan and (v) the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans issued by any given Swingline Lender exceeding $60,000,000.  Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.  The Borrower may not request, and no Swingline Lender shall issue, more than four (4) Swingline Loans denominated in Sterling in the aggregate in any calendar year.

(b)	Notice of Swingline Loans by the Borrower. To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request in writing, (i) in the case of a Swingline Loan denominated in Dollars, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of such proposed Swingline Loan, (ii) in the case of a Swingline Loan denominated in AUD, not later than 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Business Day prior to such proposed Swingline Loan, (iii) in the case of a Swingline Loan denominated in CAD, not later than 12:00 p.m., Toronto, Ontario time, on the Business Day of such proposed Swingline Loan, (iv) in the case of a Swingline Loan denominated in Euros, not later than 12:00 p.m., London time, on the Business Day of such proposed Swingline Loan and (v) in the case of a Swingline Loan denominated in Sterling, not later than 12:00 p.m., London time, on the Business Day of such proposed Swingline Loan.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the Swingline Lender from which such Swingline Loan shall be made, the requested date (which 

60

 

shall be a Business Day) and the amount of the requested Swingline Loan.  The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the applicable Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower.  Each Swingline Lender shall make each applicable Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to an account of the Administrative Agent designated for such purpose (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(f), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.  Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02, the Administrative Agent shall release the Swingline Loans to the Borrower upon receipt thereof.

(c)	Participations by Lenders in Swingline Loans.  Any Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent (i) not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time on any Business Day, in the case of outstanding Swingline Loans made by such Swingline Lender denominated in Dollars, require the Lenders of the applicable Class to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of such Swingline Loans and (ii) not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time on any Business Day, in the case of outstanding Swingline Loans made by such Swingline Lender denominated in any Foreign Currency, require the Lenders of the applicable Class to acquire participations on the third Business Day following the Business Day on which notice was received in all or a portion of such Swingline Loans.  Such notice to the Administrative Agent shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which the Multicurrency Lenders or Dollar Lenders will participate.  Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Multicurrency Lender or Dollar Lender, as applicable, specifying in such notice such Lender’s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage or Applicable Dollar Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans.  Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above in this paragraph, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of any applicable Swingline Lender, such Lender’s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage or Applicable Dollar Percentage of the applicable Swingline Loan or Loans, provided that no Multicurrency Lender shall be required to purchase a participation in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this Section if (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 would not be satisfied in respect of a Borrowing at the time such Swingline Loan was made and (y) the Required Lenders of the applicable Class shall have so notified the Administrative Agent and applicable Swingline Lender in writing prior to the time such Swingline Loan was made and shall not have subsequently determined that the circumstances giving rise to such conditions not being satisfied no longer exist.  Unless a Swingline Lender has received the written notice referred to in the previous sentence prior to the time such Swingline Loan was made that one or more applicable conditions contained in Section 4.02 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Swingline Lender shall be entitled to assume all such conditions are satisfied.

Subject to the foregoing, each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph (c) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Multicurrency Commitments or Dollar Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.08 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 

61

 

2.08 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the applicable Swingline Lender.  Any amounts received by a Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders of the applicable Class that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the applicable Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear.  The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

(d)	Replacement of Swingline Lenders.  Any Swingline Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Swingline Lender and the successor Swingline Lender.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Multicurrency Lenders or Dollar Lenders, as applicable, of any such resignation and replacement of any Swingline Lender.  In addition, if any Swingline Lender, in its capacity as a Lender, assigns all of its Loans and Commitments in connection with the terms of this Agreement, such Swingline Lender shall be deemed to have automatically resigned as a Swingline Lender hereunder.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Multicurrency Lenders or Dollar Lenders, as applicable of any such replacement of any Swingline Lender.  At the time any such replacement or resignation shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced or resigning Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.11.  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Swingline Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Swingline Lender under this Agreement with respect to Swingline Loans to be made thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Swingline Lender” and/or “Swingline Lenders” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or successors (and the other current Swingline Lenders, if applicable) or to any previous Swingline Lender, or to such successor or successors (and all other current Swingline Lenders) and all previous Swingline Lenders, as the context shall require.  After the replacement or resignation of an Swingline Lender hereunder, the replaced or resigning Swingline Lender shall have no obligation to make additional Swingline Loans.

(e)	Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Swingline Lender, any Swingline Lender may resign as a Swingline Lender at any time upon thirty days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, in which case, such Swingline Lender shall be replaced in accordance with ‎Section 2.04(d) above.

(f)	Designation of Additional Swingline Lenders. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, with the consent of the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, designate as additional Swingline Lenders one (1) or more Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a Lender of an appointment as a Swingline Lender hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such designated Lender and, from and after the effective date of such 

62

 

agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of a Swingline Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein or therein to the term “Swingline Lender” shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as a maker of Swingline Loans hereunder.

SECTION 2.05.	Letters of Credit.

(a)	General.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to the Loans provided for in Section 2.01, the Borrower may request any Issuing Bank to issue, and each Issuing Bank severally agrees to issue, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period, Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or in any Agreed Foreign Currency for its own account or the account of its designee (provided the Obligors shall remain primarily liable to the Lenders hereunder for payment and reimbursement of all amounts payable in respect of such Letter of Credit hereunder) in such form as is acceptable to both such Issuing Bank and the Borrower in their respective reasonable determinations and for the benefit of such named beneficiary or beneficiaries as are specified by the Borrower.  Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Multicurrency Commitments or the Dollar Commitments, as applicable, up to the aggregate amount then available to be drawn thereunder.  Without limiting any rights of an Issuing Bank under this Section, no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit denominated in any Foreign Currency if at the time of such issuance, such Issuing Bank, in its capacity as a Lender, would not be required to make Loans in such Foreign Currency hereunder.  

(b)	Notice of Issuance, Amendment or Extension.  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by e-mail, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by such Issuing Bank) to any Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (which shall be at least 3 Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (d) of this Section), the amount, Class and Currency of such Letter of Credit, stating that such Letter of Credit is to be issued under the Multicurrency Commitments, in the case of any Multicurrency Issuing Bank, or the Dollar Commitments, in the case of any Dollar Issuing Bank, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend or extend such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the applicable Class of Lenders following the issuance of any Letter of Credit.  If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, any Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.  

	An Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:

63

 

(i)	any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator, in each case, with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular, or any such order, judgment or decree, or law shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital or liquidity requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable on the Effective Date and that such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it; or

(ii)	the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally.

(c)	Limitations on Amounts.  A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure at such time of the Issuing Banks (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed $30,000,000 (or such greater amount as may be agreed between the Borrower and the Issuing Banks from time to time), (ii) the aggregate LC Exposure of such Issuing Bank (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed such Issuing Bank’s LC Commitment (or such greater amount as may be agreed between the Borrower and such Issuing Bank from time to time, subject to clause (c)(i) above), (iii) the total Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments and the total Revolving Dollar Credit Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Dollar Commitments, (iv) with respect to each Issuing Bank (without duplication), the sum of such Issuing Bank’s outstanding Syndicated Loans of a Class, its LC Exposure of such Class, its outstanding Swingline Loans of such Class and its Swingline Exposure of such Class shall not exceed its Commitment of such Class and (v) the total Covered Debt Amount shall not exceed the Borrowing Base then in effect.

(d)	Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the date twelve months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any or extension thereof, twelve months after the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit, so long as such extension occurs within three months of such then-current expiration date); provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide for the extension thereof for additional one-year periods; provided further, that (x) in no event shall a Letter of Credit expire after the Commitment Termination Date unless the Borrower (1) deposits Cash, on or prior to the Commitment Termination Date, into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, an amount equal to 102% of the undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit that remain outstanding as of the close of business on the Commitment Termination Date and (2) pays in full, on or prior to the Commitment Termination Date, all commissions required to be paid with respect to any such Letter of Credit through the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit and (y) no Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date after the Maturity Date.

64

 

(e)	Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by an Issuing Bank, and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Bank or the Lenders, (i) in the case of a Multicurrency Issuing Bank, such Multicurrency Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Multicurrency Lender, and each Multicurrency Lender hereby acquires from such Multicurrency Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and (ii) in the case of a Dollar Issuing Bank, such Dollar Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Dollar Lender, and each Dollar Lender hereby acquires from such Dollar Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Dollar Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the applicable Class of Commitments.

In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, (x) each Multicurrency Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Multicurrency Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Multicurrency Issuing Bank and (y) each Dollar Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Dollar Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Dollar Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Dollar Issuing Bank, in each case, promptly upon the request of such Issuing Bank at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05(f), the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

(f)	Reimbursement.  If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit issued by it, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time; provided that, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein (other than any minimum amounts, including as set forth in Section 2.02(c)), request in accordance with Section 2.03 that 

65

 

such payment be financed with a Term Benchmark Borrowing having an Interest Period of one month’s duration of either Class, an RFR Borrowing, an ABR Borrowing or a Swingline Loan of either Class in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Term Benchmark Borrowing having an Interest Period of one month’s duration, an RFR Borrowing, ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan, as applicable.

If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each affected Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage or Applicable Dollar Percentage, as applicable, thereof.

(g)	Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, and (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower’s obligations hereunder.

None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks, or any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Banks or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Banks; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by any Issuing Bank’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that:

(i)	the Issuing Banks may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

66

 

(ii)	the Issuing Banks shall have the right, in their sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and

(iii)	this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the Issuing Banks when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing).

(h)	Disbursement Procedures.  Each Issuing Bank shall, within the time allowed pursuant to the Letter of Credit Documents following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.  Such Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telecopy or e-mail of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the applicable Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

(i)	Interim Interest.  If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Term Benchmark Loans having an Interest Period of one month’s duration (or, if such LC Disbursement is denominated in Sterling, the rate per annum then applicable to RFR Loans for the applicable Currency); provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement within two Business Days following the date when due pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, then the provisions of Section 2.12(c) shall apply.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

(j)	Replacement of Issuing Banks.  Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Lenders of any such replacement of any Issuing Bank.  In addition, if any Issuing Bank, in its capacity as a Lender, assigns all of its Loans and Commitments in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Issuing Bank may, with the prior written consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j), or (k) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing), resign as an Issuing Bank hereunder upon not less than three Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, provided further, in determining whether to give any such consent, the Borrower may consider, among other factors, the sufficiency of availability of Letters of Credit hereunder.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all its unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b).  From and after the effective 

67

 

date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” and/or “Issuing Banks” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or successors (and the other current Issuing Banks, if applicable) or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor or successors (and all other current Issuing Banks) and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of any Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

(k)	Cash Collateralization.  If the Borrower shall be required to provide cover for its LC Exposure of a Class pursuant to Section 2.09(a), Section 2.10(c), Section 2.10(d), Section 2.10(e) or the last paragraph of Article VII, the Borrower shall promptly deposit into a segregated collateral account or accounts (herein, collectively, the “Letter of Credit Collateral Account”) in the name and under the dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, Cash denominated in the Currency of the Letter of Credit under which such LC Exposure arises in an amount equal to the amount required under Section 2.09(a), Section 2.10(c), Section 2.10(d), Section 2.10(e) or the last paragraph of Article VII, as applicable.  Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral in the first instance for its LC Exposure under this Agreement and thereafter for the payment of the Secured Obligations, and for these purposes the Borrower hereby grants a security interest to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other property held therein.  If the Borrower is required to provide cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in this Section 2.05(k)) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(ii), such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in this Section 2.05(k)) shall be returned to the Borrower as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures would not exceed the aggregate Commitments.

(l)	Designation of Additional Issuing Banks.  The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), designate as additional Issuing Banks one (1) or more Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a Lender of an appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such designated Lender and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein or therein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an issuer of Letters of Credit hereunder.

SECTION 2.06.	Funding of Borrowings.

68

 

(a)	Funding by Lenders.  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., Local Time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04.  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(f) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.

(b)	Presumption by the Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in the corresponding Currency with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the NYFRB Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Term Benchmark Loans having an Interest Period of one month’s duration made to the Borrower (or, if such LC Disbursement is denominated in Sterling, the rate per annum then applicable to RFR Loans for the applicable Currency).  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Nothing in this paragraph shall relieve any Lender of its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder, and shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 2.07.	Interest Elections.

(a)	Elections by the Borrower for Borrowings.  Subject to Section 2.03(d), the Loans constituting each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section; provided, however, that (i) a Borrowing of a Class may only be continued or converted into a Borrowing of the same Class, (ii) a Borrowing denominated in one Currency may not be continued as, or converted into, a Borrowing in a different Currency, (iii) no Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may be continued if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures would exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments, and (iv) a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may not be converted into a Borrowing of a different Type.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders of the 

69

 

respective Class holding the Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall thereafter be considered a separate Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loan Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.  

(b)	Notice of Elections.  To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by delivery of a signed Interest Election Request or by e-mail by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such e-mail Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, telecopy or e-mail to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request signed by the Borrower.

(c)	Content of Interest Election Requests.  Each Interest Election Request (whether a written Interest Election Request or an e-mail request) shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

(i)	the Borrowing (including the Class) to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph (c) shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

(ii)	the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

(iii)	in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term Benchmark Borrowing; and

(iv)	if the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period” and permitted under Section 2.02(d). 

(d)	Notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.

(e)	Failure to Elect; Events of Default.  If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, (i) if such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a Term Benchmark Borrowing of the same Class having an Interest Period of one month’s duration, and (ii) if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing no outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing may have an Interest Period of more than one month’s duration.

70

 

SECTION 2.08.	Termination, Reduction or Increase of the Commitments.

(a)	Scheduled Termination.  Unless previously terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Commitments of each Class shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date. 

(b)	Voluntary Termination or Reduction.  The Borrower may at any time without premium or penalty terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments ratably among each Class; provided that (i) each reduction of any Commitments pursuant to this sentence shall be in an amount that is $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, if less, the entire remaining amount of the Commitments of any Class) and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, immediately after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans of any Class in accordance with Section 2.10, the total Revolving Credit Exposures of such Class would exceed the total Commitments of such Class.  

(c)	Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction.  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08 at least three Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be irrevocable; provided that any such notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments of a Class may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.

(d)	Effect of Termination or Reduction.  Each termination or reduction of Commitments of a Class made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08 shall (i) be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class and (ii) result in a permanent termination of Commitments in an amount equal to the Commitments so terminated or reduced.  Each Lender authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to, concurrently with and immediately after the effectiveness of any termination or reduction of Commitments pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08, amend Schedule I to reflect the aggregate amount of each Lender’s aggregate Commitments.

(e)	Increase of the Commitments.

(i)	Requests for Increase.  The Borrower shall have the right, at any time after the Effective Date but prior to the Commitment Termination Date, to propose that the Commitments of a Class hereunder be increased (each such proposed increase being a “Commitment Increase”) by notice to the Administrative Agent, specifying each existing Lender (each an “Increasing Lender”) and/or each additional lender (each an “Assuming Lender”) that shall have agreed to an additional Commitment and the date on which such increase is to be effective (the “Commitment Increase Date”), which shall be a Business Day at least three Business Days (or such lesser period as the Administrative Agent may 

71

 

reasonably agree) after delivery of such notice and at least 30 days prior to the Commitment Termination Date; provided that no Lender shall be obligated to provide any increased Commitment; provided, further that:

(A)	each increase shall be in a minimum amount of at least $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, in such other amounts as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree);

(B)	the aggregate amount of all Commitments outstanding, at any given time, shall not exceed $1,000,000,000; 

(C)	each Assuming Lender shall be consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks holding Commitments of the same Class as such Assuming Lender (in each case, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);

(D)	no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such Commitment Increase Date or shall result from the proposed Commitment Increase; and

(E)	the representations and warranties made by the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects (unless the relevant representation and warranty already contains a materiality qualifier or, in the case of the representations and warranties in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.04, 3.11 and 3.15 of this Agreement, and in Sections 2.01, 2.02 and 2.05 through 2.09 of the Guarantee and Security Agreement, in each such case, such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Commitment Increase Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date).

(ii)	Effectiveness of Commitment Increase.  On the Commitment Increase Date for any Commitment Increase, (A) each Assuming Lender, if any, shall become a Lender hereunder as of such Commitment Increase Date with the Commitment in the amount set forth in the agreement referred to in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(y) and (B) the Commitment of the respective Class of each Increasing Lender part of such Commitment Increase, if any, shall be increased as of such Commitment Increase Date to the amount set forth in the agreement referred to in Section 2.08(e)(ii)(y); provided that:

(x)	the Administrative Agent shall have received on or prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Commitment Increase Date a certificate signed by a duly Authorized Signatory of the Borrower stating that each of the applicable conditions to such Commitment Increase set forth in the foregoing paragraph (i) has been satisfied; and

(y)	each Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent, on or prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Commitment Increase Date, an agreement, in form and substance reasonably 

72

 

satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which such Lender shall, effective as of such Commitment Increase Date, undertake a Commitment or an increase of Commitment in each case of the respective Class, duly executed by such Assuming Lender or such Increasing Lender, as applicable, and the Borrower, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent.

(iii)	Recordation into Register.  Upon its receipt of (1) an agreement referred to in clause (ii)(y) above executed by each Assuming Lender and each Increasing Lender part of such Commitment Increase, as applicable, together with the certificate referred to in clause (ii)(x) above and (2) an amended Schedule I pursuant to clause (d) above, the Administrative Agent shall, (x) if such agreement referred to in clause (ii)(y) has been completed, accept such agreement, (y) record the information contained in the amended Schedule I in the Register and (z) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.

(iv)	Adjustments of Borrowings upon Effectiveness of Increase. On each Commitment Increase Date, the Borrower shall (A) prepay the outstanding Loans (if any) of the affected Class in full, (B) simultaneously borrow new Loans of such Class hereunder in an amount equal to such prepayment (in the case of Term Benchmark Loans, with the Benchmark equal to the outstanding Benchmark and with Interest Period(s) ending on the date(s) of any then outstanding Interest Period(s), as applicable (as modified hereby); provided that with respect to subclauses (A) and (B), (x) the prepayment to, and borrowing from, any existing Lender shall be effected by book entry to the extent that any portion of the amount prepaid to such Lender will be subsequently borrowed from such Lender and (y) the existing Lenders, the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders shall make and receive payments among themselves, in a manner acceptable to the Administrative Agent, so that, after giving effect thereto, the Loans of such Class are held ratably by the Lenders of such Class in accordance with the respective Commitments of such Class (after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) and (C) pay to the Lenders of such Class the amounts, if any, payable under Section 2.16 as a result of any such prepayment. Concurrently therewith, the Lenders of such Class shall be deemed to have adjusted their participation interests in any outstanding Letters of Credit of such Class so that such interests are held ratably in accordance with their Commitments of such Class as so increased.

(v)	Terms of Loans Issued on the Commitment Increase Date.  The terms and provisions of any new Loans issued by any Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, and the Commitment Increase of any Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, shall be identical to the terms and provisions of Loans issued by, and Commitments of, the Lenders immediately prior to the applicable Commitment Increase Date (except that any upfront or similar one-time fee may be different).

SECTION 2.09.	Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

(a)	Repayment.  The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay the Loans of each Class as follows:

73

 

(i)	to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders the outstanding principal amount of each Class of Loans and all other amounts due and owing hereunder and under the other Loan Documents on the Maturity Date;

(ii)	to the applicable Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan of such Class made by such Swingline Lender denominated in Dollars, on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the fifth Business Day after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a Syndicated Borrowing of such Class is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans of such Class then outstanding; and

(iii)	to the applicable Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan of such Class made by such Swingline Lender denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, on the earlier of the (A) Maturity Date and (B)(1) in the case of any Swingline Loan denominated in GBP, the fourth Business Day after such Swingline Loan is made or (2) for any other Swingline Loan denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, the fifth Business Day after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a Syndicated Borrowing of such Class is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans of such Class then outstanding.

In addition, on the Maturity Date, to the extent any Letter of Credit is outstanding (notwithstanding the requirements of clause (y) of the second proviso of Section 2.05(d)), the Borrower shall deposit into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account Cash an amount equal to 102% of the undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding on the close of business on the Maturity Date, such deposit to be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral security for the LC Exposure under this Agreement in respect of the undrawn portion of such Letters of Credit.

(b)	Manner of Payment.  Subject to Section 2.10(e), prior to any repayment or prepayment of any Borrowings hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telecopy or e-mail of such selection not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment.  If the repayment or prepayment is denominated in Dollars and the Class to be repaid or prepaid is specified (or if no Class is specified and there is only one Class of Loans with Borrowings denominated in Dollars outstanding), the Borrower shall repay or prepay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Class pro rata and thereafter repay or prepay the remaining Borrowings within such Class in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid or prepaid first).  If the repayment or prepayment is denominated in Dollars and the Class to be repaid or prepaid is not specified, the Borrower shall repay or prepay pro rata between any outstanding ABR Borrowings of the Dollar Lenders and the Multicurrency Lenders, and thereafter repay or prepay the remaining Borrowings denominated in Dollars in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowings with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid or prepaid first).  If the repayment or prepayment is denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency (including as a result of the Borrower’s receipt of proceeds from a prepayment event in such Agreed Foreign Currency), the Borrower may, at its option, repay or prepay any outstanding Borrowings in such Currency ratably among just the Multicurrency Lenders in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid or prepaid first), and, if 

74

 

after such payment, the balance of the Borrowings denominated in such Currency is zero, then if there are any remaining proceeds, the Borrower shall repay or prepay the Loans (or provide cover for outstanding Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.05(k)) on a pro-rata basis between each outstanding Class of Revolving Credit Exposure in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid or prepaid first).  Each payment of a Borrowing of a Class shall be applied ratably to the Loans of such Class included in such Borrowing.

(c)	Maintenance of Records by Lenders.  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts and Currency of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

(d)	Maintenance of Records by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the amount and Currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount and Currency of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender of such Class hereunder and (iii) the amount and Currency of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.

(e)	Effect of Entries.  The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section 2.09 shall be prima facie evidence, absent manifest error, of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  In the event of any conflict between the Register and any other accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error.

(f)	Promissory Notes.  Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its permitted registered assigns) in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E or in such other form as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its permitted registered assigns).  

SECTION 2.10.	Prepayment of Loans.

75

 

(a)	Optional Prepayments.  The  Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or penalty except for payments under Section 2.16, subject to the requirements of this Section 2.10.

(b)	Mandatory Prepayments Due to Changes in Exchange Rates.

(i)	Determination of Amount Outstanding.  On each Revaluation Date, the Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure.  For the purpose of this determination, the outstanding principal amount of any Loan or LC Exposure that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount in the Foreign Currency of such Loan or LC Exposure, determined as of such Revaluation Date.  Upon making such determination, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Multicurrency Lenders and the Borrower thereof.

(ii)	Prepayment.  If, on such Revaluation Date, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure minus the Multicurrency LC Exposure fully cash collateralized pursuant to Section 2.05(k) on such date exceeds 105% of the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Commitments as then in effect, the Borrower shall prepay the Swingline Multicurrency Loans and Multicurrency Loans (and/or provide cover for Multicurrency LC Exposure as specified in Section 2.05(k)) within 15 Business Days following receipt of the Administrative Agent’s notice after such Revaluation Date in such aggregate amounts, if any, as shall be necessary so that after giving effect thereto and the determination of the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure as of such date the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure does not exceed the Multicurrency Commitments.

Any prepayment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be applied, first, to outstanding Swingline Multicurrency Loans, second, to outstanding Multicurrency Loans and third, as cover for Multicurrency LC Exposure.

(c)	Mandatory Prepayments due to Borrowing Base Deficiency.  In the event that at any time any Borrowing Base Deficiency shall exist, the Borrower shall (x) prepay the Loans (and/or provide cover for the Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.05(k)), (y) reduce its other Indebtedness that is included in the Covered Debt Amount or (z) otherwise remedy the Borrowing Base Deficiency, in such amounts as shall be necessary so that such Borrowing Base Deficiency is promptly cured within five Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrating such Borrowing Base Deficiency; provided that (i) the aggregate amount of such prepayment of Loans (and cover for Letters of Credit) shall be at least equal to the Revolving Credit Exposure’s ratable share (such ratable share being determined based on the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Exposures as compared to its other Indebtedness that is included in the Covered Debt Amount) of the aggregate prepayment and reduction of its other Indebtedness that is included in the Covered Debt Amount and (ii) if, within five Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrating such Borrowing Base Deficiency (and/or at such other times as the Borrower has knowledge of such Borrowing Base Deficiency), the Borrower shall present the Administrative Agent with a reasonably feasible plan to enable such Borrowing Base Deficiency to be cured within 30 

76

 

Business Days (which 30-Business Day period shall include the five Business Days permitted for delivery of such plan), then such prepayment (and/or cash collateralization), reduction or addition of assets to the Borrowing Base shall not be required to be effected immediately but may be effected in accordance with such plan (with such modifications as the Borrower may reasonably determine), so long as such Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured within such 30‑Business Day period; provided, further that solely to the extent such Borrowing Base Deficiency is due to the Borrower’s failure to satisfy the Senior Investment Minimum Covenant as a consequence of either (x) a decrease in the ratio of the Gross Borrowing Base to Senior Debt Amount or (y) a decrease in the Relevant Asset Coverage Ratio from one quarterly period to the next, such 30-Business Day period shall be extended to a 45-Business Day period solely with respect to compliance with the Senior Investment Minimum Covenant.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the existence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency shall not be a Specified Default or Event of Default hereunder until the expiration of the applicable grace or cure period.

(d)	Mandatory Prepayments due to Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency.  In the event that at any time any Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency shall exist, the Borrower shall (x) prepay the Loans (and/or provide cover for the Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.05(k)), (y) reduce its other Indebtedness that is included in the Covered Debt Amount or (z) otherwise remedy the Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency, in such amounts as shall be necessary so that such Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency is promptly cured within five Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrating such Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency; provided that (i) the aggregate amount of such prepayment of Loans (and cover for Letters of Credit) shall be at least equal to the Revolving Credit Exposure’s ratable share (such ratable share being determined based on the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Exposures as compared to its other Indebtedness that is included in the Covered Debt Amount) of the aggregate prepayment and reduction of its other Indebtedness that is included in the Covered Debt Amount and (ii) if, within five Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrating such Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency (and/or at such other times as the Borrower has knowledge of such Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency), the Borrower shall present the Administrative Agent with a reasonably feasible plan to enable such Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency to be cured within 30 Business Days (which 30-Business Day period shall include the five Business Days permitted for delivery of such plan), then such prepayment (and/or cash collateralization), reduction or addition of assets to the Borrowing Base shall not be required to be effected immediately but may be effected in accordance with such plan (with such modifications as the Borrower may reasonably determine), so long as such Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured within such 30‑Business Day period; provided, further that solely to the extent such Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency is due to the Borrower’s failure to satisfy the Senior Investment Minimum Covenant as a consequence of either (x) a decrease in the ratio of the Gross Borrowing Base to Senior Debt Amount or (y) a decrease in the Relevant Asset Coverage Ratio from one quarterly period to the next, such 30-Business Day period shall be extended to a 45-Business Day period solely with respect to compliance with the Senior Investment Minimum Covenant.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the existence of a Contingent Borrowing Base Deficiency shall not be a Specified Default or Event of Default hereunder until the expiration of the applicable grace or cure period.

77

(iv)	Equity Issuances.  In the event that the Borrower shall receive any net Cash proceeds from the issuance of Equity Interests of the Borrower (other than pursuant to any distribution or dividend reinvestment plan) at any time after the Commitment Termination Date, the Borrower shall, no later than the third Business Day following the receipt of such Cash proceeds, prepay the Loans (and/or provide cover for the Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.05(k)) in an amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of such Cash proceeds, net of (1) underwriting discounts and commissions or similar payments and other costs, fees, commissions, premiums and expenses incurred by such Obligor directly incidental to such Cash receipts, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, (2) all taxes paid or reasonably estimated to be payable by such Obligor as a result of such Cash receipts (after taking into account any available tax credits or deductions) and (3) the amount paid or distributed by the Borrower to purchase its shares of common stock in connection with tender offers following the Commitment Termination Date.

(v)	Indebtedness.  In the event that any Obligor shall receive any net Cash proceeds from the issuance of Indebtedness by an Obligor (including any repurchase 

78

 

transactions, but excluding from any Permitted Advisor Loan) at any time after the Commitment Termination Date, the Borrower shall, no later than the third Business Day following the receipt of such Cash proceeds, prepay the Loans (and/or provide cover for the Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.05(k)) in an amount equal to such Cash proceeds, net of (1) underwriting discounts and commissions or other similar payments and other costs, fees, commissions, premiums and expenses incurred by such Obligor directly incidental to such Cash receipts, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, (2) all taxes paid or reasonably estimated to be payable by such Obligor (after taking into account any available tax credits or deductions) and (3) any portion of such proceeds required to be paid by such Obligor pursuant to a concurrent Back-to-Back Transaction.

To the extent the Loans to be prepaid from proceeds from any of the events described in subsections (i) through (v) above are Term Benchmark Loans, the Borrower may defer such prepayment until the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loans, so long as the Borrower deposits an amount equal to the amount of such prepayment, no later than the third Business Day following the receipt of such proceeds, into a segregated collateral account in the name and under the dominion and control of the Administrative Agent pending application of such amount to the prepayment of such Loans on the last day of such Interest Period.

(vii)	RIC Tax Distributions.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,  any Net Asset Sale Proceeds, Extraordinary Receipts, Return of Capital or other Cash receipts required to be applied to the prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 2.10(e) shall exclude the amounts reasonably estimated or determined by the Borrower to be necessary for the Borrower to make distributions sufficient in amount to achieve the objectives set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 6.05(a) hereof to the extent the Borrower recognizes any income or gains in connection with the receipt of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds, Extraordinary Receipts, Return of Capital or other Cash receipts and the recognition of such income or gains results in an increase in the amounts required to be distributed by the Borrower to achieve such objectives.

(f)	Payments Following the Commitment Termination Date or During an Event of Default.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Section 2.09 or this Section 2.10, following the Commitment Termination Date:

(i)	No optional prepayment of the Loans of any Class shall be permitted unless at such time, the Borrower also prepays its Loans of the other Class or, to the extent no Loans of the other Class are outstanding, provides cash collateral as contemplated by Section 2.05(k) for the outstanding Letters of Credit of such Class, which prepayment (and cash collateral) shall be made on a pro-rata basis (based on the outstanding principal amounts of such Indebtedness) between each outstanding Class of Revolving Credit Exposure; 

(ii)	Any prepayment of Loans denominated in Dollars required to be made in connection with any of the events specified in Section 2.10(e) shall be applied ratably (based on the outstanding principal amounts of such Indebtedness) between the Dollar 

79

 

Lenders and the Multicurrency Lenders based on the then outstanding Loans and Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars; and

(iii)	Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then any payment or repayment of the Loans shall be made and applied ratably (based on the aggregate Dollar Equivalents of the outstanding principal amounts of such Loans) between Dollar Loans, Multicurrency Loans and Letters of Credit.

(g)	Notices, Etc.

(i)	The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the applicable Swingline Lender) in writing by telecopy or e-mail of any prepayment hereunder (A) in the case of prepayment of a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars under Section 2.10(a), not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (B) in the case of prepayment of a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency (other than AUD), under Section 2.10(a), not later than 12:00 p.m., London time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (C) in the case of prepayment of a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in AUD under Section 2.10(a), not later than 12:00 p.m., London time, four Business Days before the date of prepayment, (D) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing under Section 2.10(a) or any prepayment under Section 2.10(b), (c), (d) or (e), not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of prepayment, (E) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan denominated in Dollars, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment, (F) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, not later than 12:00 noon London time, one Business Day prior to the date of prepayment (G) in the case of prepayment of an RFR Borrowing denominated in Sterling, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, four Business Days before the date of prepayment or (H) in each case of the notice periods described in clauses (A) through (C), such lesser period as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree with respect to notices given in connection with any of the events specified in Section 2.10(e)(ii) or (iii).  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that any such notice of prepayment may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the affected Lenders of the contents thereof.  Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and shall be made in the manner specified in Section 2.09(b).

prepayment required to be made pursuant to paragraph (c) and the amount of the payment required pursuant to paragraph (c) (if any) shall be determined immediately after giving effect to the prepayment made (or to be made) under such other paragraph of this Section 2.10.

SECTION 2.11.	Fees.

(a)	Commitment Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at a rate of 0.375% per annum on the daily unused amount of the Dollar Commitment and Multicurrency Commitment, as applicable, of such Lender during the period beginning on the Effective Date to but excluding the earlier of the date such Commitment terminates and the Commitment Termination Date.  Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the fifteenth day after each Quarterly Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date, and ending on the earlier of the date the Commitments of the respective Class terminate and the Commitment Termination Date.  All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  For purposes of computing commitment fees, (i) the daily unused amount of the applicable Commitment shall be determined as of the end of each day and (ii) the Commitment of any Class of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Loans of such Class of such Lender and LC Exposure of such Class of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Class of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose).

(b)	Letter of Credit Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin applicable to interest on Term Benchmark Loans (or, if such Letter of Credit is denominated in Sterling, RFR Loans) on the daily maximum amount of such Lender’s LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s Commitment of the applicable Class terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure of such Class, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the daily maximum amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) applicable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as each Issuing Bank’s standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.  Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including each Quarterly Date shall be payable in arrears on the fifteenth day following such Quarterly Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that, all such fees with respect to the Letters of Credit shall be payable on the date on which all Commitments of the applicable Class terminate (the “termination date”), the Borrower shall pay any such fees that have accrued and that are unpaid on the termination date and, in the event any Letters of Credit shall be outstanding that have expiration dates after the termination date, the Borrower shall prepay on the termination date the full amount of the participation and fronting fees that will accrue on such Letters of Credit subsequent to the termination date through but not including the 

81

 

date such outstanding Letters of Credit are scheduled to expire (and in that connection, the Lenders agree not later than the date two Business Days after the date upon which the last such Letter of Credit shall expire or be terminated to rebate to the Borrower the excess, if any, of the aggregate participation and fronting fees that have been prepaid by the Borrower over the amount of such fees that ultimately accrue through the date of such expiration or termination).  Any other fees payable to the Issuing Banks pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand.  All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last date).

(c)	Administrative Agent Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

(d)	Payment of Fees.  All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars and immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Banks, in the case of fees payable to them) for distribution, in the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto.  Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances absent manifest error.  Any fees representing the Borrower’s reimbursement obligations of expenses, to the extent the requirements of an invoice are not otherwise specified in this Agreement, shall be due (subject to the other terms and conditions contained herein) within ten Business Days of the date that the Borrower receives from the Administrative Agent a reasonably detailed invoice for such reimbursement obligations.  

SECTION 2.12.	Interest.

(a)	ABR Loans.  The Loans constituting each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan denominated in Dollars) shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

(b)	Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans.  (i) The Loans constituting each Term Benchmark Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Term Benchmark for the applicable Currency for the related Interest Period for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) the Loans constituting each RFR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR plus the Applicable Margin.

(c)	Foreign Currency Swingline Loans.  (i) Swingline Loans denominated in Euros shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple ESTR plus the Applicable Margin, (ii) Swingline Loans denominated in Sterling shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR plus the Applicable Margin and (iii) Swingline Loans denominated in CAD shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

(d)	Default Interest.  Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), if any principal of or interest on any Loan, LC Disbursement or any recurring or scheduled fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due (after giving effect to any grace or cure period), whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or 

82

 

otherwise, such overdue amount shall, at the request of the Required Lenders, bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any interest on any Loan, LC Disbursement or any recurring or scheduled fee or other amount, 2% plus (x) if such other amount is denominated in Dollars, the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.12, (y) if such other amount is denominated in a Foreign Currency (other than Sterling), the rate applicable to Term Benchmark Loans as provided in paragraph (b)(i) of this Section 2.12 or (z) if such other amount is denominated in Sterling, the rate applicable to RFR Loans as provided in paragraph (b)(ii) of this Section 2.12.

(e)	Payment of Interest.  Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan in the Currency in which such Loan is denominated and upon the Maturity Date; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 2.12 shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the Maturity Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Borrowing shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

SECTION 2.13.	Alternate Rate of Interest. 

(a)	Subject to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this Section: 

(i)	the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Term SOFR Rate, the AUD Rate, the CDOR Rate, Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, the EURIBOR Rate or applicable Local Rate (including because the relevant screen rate is not available or published on a current basis), for the applicable Currency and such Interest Period or (B) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR, Daily Simple RFR or RFR for the applicable Currency; or

(ii)	the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders of any affected Class with respect to such Class that (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Term SOFR Rate, the AUD Rate, the CDOR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, the EURIBOR Rate or applicable Local Rate for the applicable Currency and such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for the applicable Currency and such Interest Period or (B) at any time, the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for the applicable Currency will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for the applicable Currency,

83

 

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the affected Lenders in writing by e-mail as promptly as practicable thereafter setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination and, until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.08 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.03, (A) for Loans denominated in Dollars, any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing and any Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing shall instead be deemed to be an Interest Election Request or a Borrowing Request, as applicable, for (x) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not also the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above or (y) an ABR Borrowing if the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings also is the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above and (B) for Loans denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing and any Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing, in each case, for the relevant Benchmark, shall be ineffective; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then all other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted; provided further that, in connection with any ABR Borrowing made pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.13(a), the determination of the Alternate Base Rate shall disregard clause (c) of the definition thereof.   Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Agreed Foreign Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower’s receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in this ‎Section 2.13(a) with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.08 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.03, (A) for Loans denominated in Dollars, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not also the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above or (y) an ABR Borrowing if the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings also is the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above and, (B) for Loans denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan and (2) any RFR Loan shall immediately, bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans denominated in any Agreed Foreign Currency shall, at the Borrower’s election prior to such day: (A) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (B) be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Loan) on such day and (C) any RFR Loan shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central 

84

 

Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected RFR Loans denominated in any Agreed Foreign Currency, at the Borrower’s election, shall either (i) be converted into ABR Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Agreed Foreign Currency) immediately or (ii) be prepaid in full immediately.

 

(b)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document (and any Hedging Agreement shall be deemed not to be a “Loan Document” for purposes of this Section 2.13), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” with respect to Dollars for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” with respect to any Currency for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders of each affected Class. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.

(c)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document other than as provided in the definition of Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes (provided that the Administrative Agent’s determination shall be generally consistent with determinations made for borrowers of syndicated loans in the United States denominated in the applicable Currency).

(d)	The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (f) below and (v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.13, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be 

85

 

conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.13.

(e)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.

(f)	Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, either (x) the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for (1) a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to (A) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (B) an ABR Borrowing if the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) any Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency shall be ineffective. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement for such Currency is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.13, (i) for Loans denominated in Dollars, any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) an ABR Loan if the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event, on such day or (ii) if such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan is denominated in any Agreed Foreign Currency, then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, at the Borrower’s election prior to such day: (A) bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency plus the Applicable Margin; provided that, if the Administrative Agent 

86

 

determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, the Borrower may not make an election under this subclause (A), (B) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (C) be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and (subject to the remainder of this subclause (C)) shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Loan) on such day (it being understood and agreed that if the Borrower does not so prepay such Loan on such day by 12:00 noon, Local Time, the Administrative Agent is authorized to effect such conversion of such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, as applicable, into an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars).

SECTION 2.14.	Computation of Interest.  All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (a) Term Benchmark Borrowings in Canadian Dollars, AUD shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) and (b) RFR Borrowings, and ABR Borrowings, at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate, shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate, EURIBOR Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, Adjusted Daily Simple RFR or Daily Simple RFR shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.15.	Increased Costs.

(a)	If any Change in Law shall:

(i)	impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, compulsory loan, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or

(ii)	impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense, affecting this Agreement or Term Benchmark Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank or participation by such Lender therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost (other than costs which are (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Connection Income Taxes or (C) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes) to such Lender of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any Term Benchmark Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost (other than costs which are Taxes) to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that no Lender will claim the 

87

 

payment of any of the amounts referred to in this paragraph (a) if not generally claiming similar compensation from its other similar customers in similar circumstances.

(b)	Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Swingline Loans and in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements), by an amount deemed to be material by such Lender or such Issuing Bank, then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered; provided that no Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, will claim the payment of any of the amounts referred to in this paragraph (b) if not generally claiming similar compensation from its other similar customers in similar circumstances.

(c)	Certificates from Lenders.  A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank (x) setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the calculation of the amount or amounts, in Dollars, necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and (y) certifying that such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, is generally claiming similar compensation from its other similar customers in similar circumstances, shall be promptly delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided, however that no Lender shall be requested to disclose confidential or price sensitive information or any other information, to the extent prohibited by applicable law.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.

(d)	Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than three months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the three-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 2.16.	Break Funding Payments.  With respect to Term Benchmark Loans, in the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor (including as a result of the occurrence of any 

88

 

Commitment Increase Date or an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Term Benchmark Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (including, in connection with any Commitment Increase Date, and regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(g) and is revoked in accordance herewith) or (d) the assignment as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.20(b) of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each affected Lender for such Lender’s loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (excluding loss of anticipated profits).  Payments under this Section shall be made upon written request of a Lender delivered to the Borrower not later than 10 Business Days following a payment, conversion, or failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay that gives rise to a claim under this Section accompanied by a written certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and calculation of the amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.

SECTION 2.17.	Taxes.  

(a)	Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (i) the Borrower shall make such deductions or withholding, (ii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and (iii) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the Administrative Agent, the applicable Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.

(b)	Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  In addition, the Borrower shall pay, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(c)	Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank for, and within 30 Business Days after written demand therefor, pay the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such recipient and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A written certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

89

 

(d)	Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(e)	Foreign Lenders.  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

In addition, any applicable Foreign Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Foreign Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable:

(i)	duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable) or any successor form claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,

(ii)	duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or any successor form certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States,

(iii)	in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (A) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (1) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (3) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (B) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable) (or any successor form), or

(iv)	any other form including Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY as applicable prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a 

90

 

reduction in United States federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.

(f)	United States Lenders.  Each Lender and each Issuing Bank that is not a Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prior to the date on which such Issuing Bank or such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, and at times reasonably requested by the Borrower, duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any successor form, certificate or documentation provided it is legally able to do so at the time.

(g)	FATCA.  If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (g), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

In addition, each Lender agrees that if any certificate or documentation previously delivered under this Section by such Lender expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect it shall update such certificate or documentation, provided it is legally able to do so at the time.  Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time the chief tax officer of such Lender becomes aware that it no longer satisfies the legal requirements to provide any previously delivered form, certificate or documentation to the Borrower (or any other form, certificate or documentation adopted by the U.S. or other taxing authorities for such purpose).

 

(h)	Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank is 

91

 

required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns or its books or records (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

(i)	Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

(j)	Defined Terms.  For purposes of this Section, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.

SECTION 2.18.	Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.

(a)	Payments by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All amounts owing under this Agreement (including commitment fees, payments required under Section 2.15, and payments required under Section 2.16 relating to any Loan denominated in Dollars, but not including principal of, and interest on, any Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.16 or any reimbursement or cash collateralization of any LC Exposure denominated in any Foreign Currency, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan or LC Disbursement when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment 

92

 

or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan or such LC Disbursement shall, if such Loan or such LC Disbursement is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or LC Disbursement that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand.

(b)	Application of Insufficient Payments.  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees of a Class then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees of such Class then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due to such parties.  

(c)	Pro Rata Treatment.  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:  (i) each Borrowing of a Class shall be made from the Lenders of such Class, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under Section 2.08 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders of such Class, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; (ii) each Borrowing of a Class shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the making of Loans) or their respective Loans of such Class that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment of commitment fees under Section 2.11 shall be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata according to the average daily unutilized amounts of their respective Commitments; (iv) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for the account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans of such Class held by them; and (v) each payment of interest on Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for the account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to such Lenders.  

(d)	Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender of a Class shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, within its Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon of such Class then due than the proportion received by any other Lender of such Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders of such Class to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of 

93

 

principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of such Class; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (d) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph (d) shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing, and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower may make a Borrowing under the Dollar Commitments or Multicurrency Commitments (if otherwise permitted hereunder) and may use the proceeds of such Borrowing (x) with Dollar Commitments to prepay the Multicurrency Loans (without making a ratable prepayment of the Dollar Loans) or (y) with Multicurrency Commitments to prepay the Dollar Loans (without making a ratable payment to the Multicurrency Loans).

(e)	Presumptions of Payment.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

(f)	Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent.  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(e), 2.06(b) or 2.18(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

SECTION 2.19.	Defaulting Lenders.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:

94

 

(a)	commitment fees pursuant to Section 2.11(a) shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender to the extent and during the period such Lender is a Defaulting Lender; 

(b)	the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether two-thirds of the Lenders, two-thirds of the Lenders of a Class, the Required Lenders or the Required Lenders of a Class have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Documents (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders (or all Lenders of a Class) or each affected Lender (if applicable to such Defaulting Lender), including as set forth in Section 9.02(b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender;

(c)	if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:

(i)	all or any part of such Swingline Exposure (other than the portion of such Swingline Exposure consisting of Swingline Loans made by such Defaulting Lender) and LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non‑Defaulting Lenders holding Commitments of the same Class as such Defaulting Lender in accordance with their respective Applicable Multicurrency Percentages or Applicable Dollar Percentages, as applicable, but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures of such Class plus such Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Class does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Commitments of such Class and (y) no non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure of such Class will exceed such Lender’s Commitment of such Class;

(ii)	if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, within three Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(k) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;

(iii)	if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such LC Exposure during the period such LC Exposure is cash collateralized;

(iv)	if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders of the same Class as such Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non‑Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable Multicurrency Percentages or Applicable Dollar Percentages, as applicable, in effect immediately after giving effect to such reallocation; 

95

 

(v)	if any Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.19(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all commitment fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and

(vi)	no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation; and

(d)	so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swingline Lenders shall be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank of the same Class as such Defaulting Lender shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit of such Class, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non‑Defaulting Lenders of such Class and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.19(c), and Swingline Exposure related to any newly made Swingline Loan and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders of such Class in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).

In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Banks (with respect to the Swingline Lenders and any Issuing Bank, only to the extent that such Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank acts in such capacity under the same Class of Commitments held by a Defaulting Lender) each agrees in writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then, on the date of such agreement, such Lender shall no longer be deemed a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall no longer be required to cash collateralize any portion of such Lender’s LC Exposure cash collateralized pursuant to Section 2.19(c)(ii) above and the Swingline Exposure and the LC Exposure of the Lenders of the affected Class shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Commitment of such Class and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par the portion of the Loans of the other Lenders of such Class (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Multicurrency Percentage or Applicable Dollar Percentage, as applicable, in effect immediately after giving effect to such agreement.

SECTION 2.20.	Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

(a)	Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall at the request of the Borrower use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable 

96

 

judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any cost or expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

(b)	Replacement of Lenders.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or is a non-consenting Lender (as provided in Section 9.02(d)), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.15 and Section 2.17) and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts then due and payable), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case of any assignment as a result of a non-consenting Lender (that the Borrower is permitted to replace as provided in Section 9.02(d)), the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

(c)	Defaulting Lender.  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(e), 2.06 or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Banks to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

SECTION 2.21.	Maximum Rate.

97

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all related Charges, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.  To the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of a Loan, but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section, shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

109

 

records maintained by it in its capacity as a “servicer” in respect of any Designated Subsidiary or other Excluded Assets, but only to the extent the Borrower is not prohibited from disclosing such information or providing access to such information and any books, records and documents held by the Custodian), and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition with its officers and independent accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as reasonably requested, in each case, to the extent such inspection or requests for such information are reasonable and such information can be provided or discussed without violation of law, rule, regulation or contract; provided that the Borrower shall be entitled to have its representatives and advisors present during any inspection of its books and records and during any discussion with its independent accountants or independent auditors; provided further that the Borrower shall not be responsible for the costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for more than one visit and inspection in any calendar year under this Section 5.06 and Section 7.01(b) of the Guarantee and Security Agreement unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations, including the Investment Company Act, any applicable rules, regulations or orders issued by the SEC thereunder (in each case, if applicable to such Person) and orders of any other Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  The Borrower will maintain in effect and enforce policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by the Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions in all material respects.

SECTION 5.08.	Certain Obligations Respecting Subsidiaries; Further Assurances.

(a)	Subsidiary Guarantors.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower may elect to cause any of its Excluded Assets or Immaterial Subsidiaries to become an Obligor by causing such Person to become a Subsidiary Guarantor and executing and delivering a Guarantee Assumption Agreement and other deliverables as required for a Subsidiary Guarantor under this Section 5.08(a) (at which point such Person shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor and shall no longer be an Excluded Asset or an Immaterial Subsidiary, as applicable).

110

 

(b)	Ownership of Subsidiaries.  The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries (other than any Subsidiary that is an Excluded Asset) to, take such action from time to time as shall be necessary to ensure that each of its Subsidiaries (other than any Subsidiary that is an Excluded Asset) is a wholly owned Subsidiary; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any transaction permitted under Section 6.03 or 6.04, so long as immediately after giving effect to such permitted transaction each of the remaining Subsidiaries is a wholly-owned Subsidiary (other than any Subsidiary that is an Excluded Asset).

(c)	Further Assurances.  The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to, take such action from time to time (including filing appropriate Uniform Commercial Code financing statements and executing and delivering such assignments, security agreements and other instruments) as shall reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent to effectuate the purposes and objectives of this Agreement, including:

(i)	to create, in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Lenders (and any Affiliate thereof that is a party to any Hedging Agreement entered into with such Obligor) and the holders of any Other Secured Indebtedness, perfected security interests and Liens in the Collateral; provided that any such security interest or Lien shall be subject to the relevant requirements of the Security Documents; provided further, that in the case of any Collateral consisting of voting stock of any Controlled Foreign Corporation, such security interest shall be limited to 65% of the issued and outstanding voting stock of such Controlled Foreign Corporation,

(ii)	subject to Section 5.14 hereof and Sections 7.01 and 7.04 of the Guarantee and Security Agreement, to cause any bank or securities intermediary (within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code) to enter into such arrangements with the Collateral Agent as shall be appropriate in order that the Collateral Agent has “control” over each deposit account or securities account of the Obligors (in each case, other than any Excluded Accounts (as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement)) and in that connection, the Borrower agrees to cause all cash and other proceeds of Portfolio Investments received by any Obligor to be promptly deposited into such an account (or otherwise delivered to, or registered in the name of, the Collateral Agent) and, until such deposit, delivery or registration such cash and other proceeds shall be held in trust by the Borrower for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and shall not be commingled with any other funds of such Obligor, any Designated Subsidiary or any other Person (including with any money or financial assets of any Obligor in its capacity as “servicer” for any such Designated Subsidiary or any other Excluded Assets, or any money or financial assets of any Excluded Asset),

(iii)	in the case of any portfolio investment held by an Excluded Asset or an Immaterial Subsidiary, including any cash collection related thereto, ensure that such portfolio investment shall not be held in the account of any Obligor subject to a control agreement among such Obligor, the Collateral Agent and the Custodian delivered in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document,

(iv)	in the case of any Portfolio Investment consisting of a Bank Loan that does not constitute all of the credit extended to the underlying borrower under the relevant 

111

 

underlying loan documents and an Excluded Asset or an Immaterial Subsidiary holds any interest in the loans or other extensions of credit under such loan documents, (x) cause such Excluded Asset or such Immaterial Subsidiary to be party to such underlying loan documents as a “lender” having a direct interest (or a participation; provided that any participation acquired from an Obligor shall give such Excluded Asset or such Immaterial Subsidiary the right to elevate such participation to an assignment at any time in its sole discretion, which right shall be exercised no later than 90 days after the acquisition thereof) in such underlying loan documents and the extensions of credit thereunder and (y) ensure that, subject to Section 5.08(c)(v) below, all amounts owing to such Obligor or such Excluded Asset or Immaterial Subsidiary by the underlying borrower or other obligated party are remitted by such borrower or obligated party (or the applicable administrative agents, collateral agents or equivalent Person) directly to the accounts of such Obligor, such Excluded Asset and such Immaterial Subsidiary, respectively; provided that, in the case of a participation interest by any Excluded Asset or Immaterial Subsidiary, such Portfolio Investment, including any cash collection related thereto, may be held in the account of any Obligor subject to a control agreement among such Obligor, the Collateral Agent and the Custodian delivered in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 

(v)	in the event that any Obligor, Excluded Asset or Immaterial Subsidiary is acting as an agent or administrative agent (or analogous capacity) under any loan documents with respect to any Bank Loan and such Obligor, Excluded Asset or Immaterial Subsidiary, as applicable, does not hold all of the credit extended to the underlying borrower under the relevant underlying loan documents, ensure that all funds held by such Obligor, Excluded Asset or Immaterial Subsidiary, as applicable, in such capacity as agent or administrative agent are segregated from all other funds of such Obligor, Excluded Asset or Immaterial Subsidiary, as applicable, and are clearly identified as being held in an agency capacity, and

(vi)	cause all credit or loan agreements, any notes and all assignment and assumption agreements, as applicable, relating to any Portfolio Investment constituting part of the Collateral to be held by (x) the Collateral Agent, (y) a Custodian pursuant to the terms of the applicable Custodian Agreement, or (z) pursuant to an appropriate intercreditor agreement, so long as such Custodian has agreed to grant access to such loan and other documents to the Administrative Agent pursuant to an access or similar agreement between the Borrower and such Custodian in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; provided that the Borrower’s obligation to deliver underlying documentation may be satisfied by delivery of copies of such agreements. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (1) nothing contained herein shall prevent an Obligor from having a Participation Interest in a portfolio investment held by an Excluded Asset and (2) if any instrument, promissory note, agreement, document or certificate held by the Custodian is destroyed or lost not as a result of any action of such Obligor, then any original of such instrument, promissory note, agreement, document or certificate shall be deemed held by the Custodian for all purposes hereunder; provided that, when such Obligor has actual knowledge of any such destroyed or lost instrument, promissory note, agreement, document or 

112

 

certificate, it shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the underlying borrower, and deliver to the Custodian, a replacement instrument, promissory note, agreement, document or certificate.

 

SECTION 5.09.	Use of Proceeds.  The Borrower will use the proceeds of its Loans and the issuances of Letters of Credit only for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, (a) repaying outstanding Indebtedness not prohibited by the Loan Documents, (b) paying fees and expenses paid or payable in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (c) making other distributions, contributions and investments, and the acquisition and funding (either directly or through one (1) or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) of leveraged loans, mezzanine loans, high yield securities, convertible securities, preferred stock, common stock, Hedging Agreements and other Portfolio Investments; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any responsibility as to the use of any of such proceeds. No part of the proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit will be used in violation of Sanctions or any other applicable law or, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying any Margin Stock (except as set forth in Section 3.11(d)). Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall furnish to such Lender a statement in conformity with the requirements of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U-1, as applicable, referred to in Regulation U.  The Borrower will not request any Borrowing or Letter of Credit, and the Borrower shall not use, and shall procure that its Subsidiaries and its or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall not use, the proceeds of any Borrowing or Letter of Credit (A) in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment or giving of money, or anything else of value, to any Person in violation of any Anti-Corruption Laws, (B) for the purpose of funding, financing or facilitating any activities, business or transaction of or with any Sanctioned Person, in violation of any applicable Sanctions, or in any Sanctioned Country, to the extent such activities, businesses or transactions would be prohibited by Sanctions if conducted by a corporation incorporated in the United States, or (C) in any manner that would result in the violation of any Sanctions applicable to any party hereto.  

SECTION 5.10.	Status of RIC and BDC.  The Borrower intends to elect RIC treatment with respect to the taxable year ending December 31, 2023 upon filing applicable tax returns in 2024.

SECTION 5.11.	Investment and Valuation Policies.  The Borrower shall promptly advise the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of any material change in either its Investment Policies or Valuation Policy.

SECTION 5.12.	Portfolio Valuation and Diversification, Etc.

(a)	Industry Classification Groups.  For purposes of this Agreement, the Borrower shall assign each Portfolio Investment to an Industry Classification Group.  To the extent that the Borrower reasonably determines that any Portfolio Investment is not adequately correlated with the risks of other Portfolio Investments in an Industry Classification Group, such Portfolio Investment may be assigned by the Borrower to an Industry Classification Group that is 

113

 

more closely correlated to such Portfolio Investment.  In the absence of adequate correlation, the Borrower shall be permitted, upon notice to the Administrative Agent for distribution to each Lender to create up to three additional Industry Classification Groups for purposes of this Agreement.  Furthermore, for Portfolio Investments in the software industry, the Borrower may assign such Portfolio Investment to the Industry Classification Group based on the predominant end-user of the applicable issuer’s product.

(b)	Portfolio Valuation Etc.

(i)	Settlement Date Basis.  For purposes of this Agreement, all determinations of whether an investment is to be included as a Portfolio Investment shall be determined on a settlement date basis (meaning that any investment that has been purchased will not be treated as a Portfolio Investment until such purchase has settled, and any Portfolio Investment which has been sold will not be excluded as a Portfolio Investment until such sale has settled); provided that no such investment shall be included as a Portfolio Investment to the extent it has not been paid for in full.

(ii)	Determination of Values.  The Borrower will conduct reviews of the value to be assigned to each of its Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base as follows:

(A)	Quoted Investments—External Review.  With respect to Portfolio Investments (including Cash Equivalents) traded in an active and orderly market for which market quotations are readily available, in each case, as determined by the Borrower (“Quoted Investments”), the Borrower shall, not less frequently than once each calendar week, determine the market value of such Quoted Investments which shall, in each case, be determined in accordance with one of the following methodologies (as selected by the Borrower):

(w)	in the case of public and 144A securities, the average of the bid prices as determined by at least two Approved Dealers selected by the Borrower or an Approved Pricing Service selected by the Borrower which makes reference to at least two Approved Dealers with respect to such public and 144A securities,

(x)	in the case of Bank Loans, the average of the bid prices as determined by at least two Approved Dealers selected by the Borrower or an Approved Pricing Service selected by the Borrower which makes reference to at least two Approved Dealers with respect to such Bank Loans, or if only one bid price is available, such bid price,

(y)	in the case of any Quoted Investment traded on an exchange, the closing price for such Portfolio Investment most recently posted on such exchange, and

(z)	in the case of any other Quoted Investment, the fair market value thereof as determined by an Approved Pricing Service; and

114

 

(B)	Unquoted Investments—External Review.  With respect to Portfolio Investments not traded in an active and orderly market or for which market quotations are not readily available, in each case, as determined by the Borrower (“Unquoted Investments”), the Borrower shall determine the fair value of such Unquoted Investments quarterly in a manner consistent with its Valuation Policy (except as otherwise required by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, but in all cases using fair value principles), and shall obtain the valuation of at least 25% by value of all Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base using the assistance of an Approved Third-Party Appraiser; provided, the Borrower may rely on the valuations of the Unquoted Investments obtained pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(iii)(A) in lieu of obtaining the valuations pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B); provided further that, if (1) a Portfolio Investment has a Value less than 1% of the Collateral Pool (in an aggregate maximum amount not to exceed 15% by value of all Portfolio Investments) or (2) a Portfolio Investment is acquired during a fiscal quarter (unless the Value is otherwise obtained by the Independent Valuation Provider), the Value of such Portfolio Investment described in (1) and (2) shall not be included when determining the percentage of Portfolio Investments required to be valued in such quarter. The Value of any such Portfolio Investment described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to be equal to the lower of (x) the Value of such Portfolio Investment determined by the Borrower in accordance with Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) and (y) the cost of such Portfolio Investment.  The Administrative Agent and each Lender acknowledges that it may be required to enter into a non-reliance letter, confidentiality agreement or similar agreement requested or required by a proposed appraiser to allow the Administrative Agent or such Lender to review any written valuation report.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, there shall be no requirement to disclose any portion of any report submitted by the Approved Third-Party Appraiser without such a non-reliance letter if such non-reliance letter is required by such Approved Third-Party Appraiser as a condition to such disclosure. 

(C)	Internal Review.  The Borrower shall conduct an internal review of the aggregate value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base, at least once each calendar week, which shall take into account any event of which the Borrower has knowledge that materially adversely affects the aggregate value of such Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base.  If, based upon such weekly internal review, the Borrower determines that a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, then the Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days as provided in Section 5.01(e), deliver a Borrowing Base Certificate reflecting the new amount of the Borrowing Base and shall take the actions, and make the payments and prepayments on the Loans (and/or provide cover for Letters of Credit), all as more specifically set forth in Section 2.10(c).

(D)	Failure to Determine Values.  If the Borrower shall fail to determine the value of any Portfolio Investment as at any date pursuant to the requirements (but subject to the exclusions) of the foregoing subclauses (A) through (C), the “Value” of such Portfolio Investment as at such date shall be 

115

 

deemed to be zero for purposes of the Borrowing Base until such time as the value of such Portfolio Investment is determined in accordance with this Agreement.

(E)	Initial Value of Assets.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from the Effective Date until the date when the first valuation reports are required to be delivered under Section 5.01(i), the Value of any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base with respect to each Borrower shall be the Value as determined in a manner consistent with Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) and as delivered to the Collateral Agent on or prior to the Effective Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) the value of any Portfolio Investments determined in accordance with any provision of this Section 5.12 shall be the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement until a new Value for such Portfolio Investment is subsequently determined in good faith in accordance with this Section 5.12

provided that, the Borrower shall value substantially all Portfolio Investments pursuant to the foregoing requirements no less frequently than once in any rolling twelve-month period. 

 

(iii)	Scheduled Testing of Values.

(A)	Each February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 of each calendar year, commencing on May 31, 2023 (or such other dates as are agreed to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, but in no event less frequently than once per calendar quarter, each a “Valuation Testing Date”), the Administrative Agent through an Independent Valuation Provider will test the values determined, or required to be determined, pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) of those Unquoted Investments (x) included in the Borrowing Base as of such Valuation Testing Date or at any time between such Valuation Testing Date and the immediately preceding Valuation Testing Date, in each case, unless such Portfolio Investment is no longer in the Collateral Pool pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder and (y) selected by the Administrative Agent; provided, that the aggregate value of such Unquoted Investments tested on any Valuation Testing Date will be equal to the Tested Amount (as defined below) (or as near thereto as reasonably practical). For the avoidance of doubt, Unquoted Investments that are part of the Collateral but not included in the Borrowing Base as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date or at any time between the applicable Valuation Testing Date and the immediately preceding Valuation Testing Date (unless such Portfolio Investment is no longer in the Collateral Pool pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder) shall not be subject to testing under this Section 5.12(b)(iii).

(B)	For purposes of this Agreement, the “Tested Amount” shall be equal to the greater of:  (i) an amount equal to (y) 125% of the Covered Debt Amount (as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date) minus (z) the sum of the values of all Cash and all Quoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base (as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date) and (ii) 10% of the aggregate value of all Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base (as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date); provided, however, in no event shall more than 25% (or, if clause (ii) applies, 10%, or as near thereto as 

116

 

reasonably practicable) of the aggregate value of the Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base be tested by the Independent Valuation Provider in respect of any applicable Valuation Testing Date.  If the Value of the Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base is less than the “Tested Amount” as calculated in the immediately preceding sentence, then the “Tested Amount” shall equal the Value of such Unquoted Investments.  

(C)	With respect to any Unquoted Investment, if the value of such Unquoted Investment determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is not more than the lesser of (1) five (5) points more than the midpoint of the valuation range (expressed as a percentage of par) provided by the Independent Valuation Provider (provided that the value of such Unquoted Investment is customarily quoted as a percentage of par, otherwise this clause (1) shall not be applicable) and (2) 110% of the midpoint of the valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider, then the value for such Unquoted Investment determined in accordance with Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall continue to be used as the “Value” for purposes of this Agreement.  If the value of any Unquoted Investment determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is more than the lesser of the values set forth in clause (C)(1) and (2) (to the extent applicable), then for such Unquoted Investment, the “Value” for purposes of this Agreement shall become the least of (x) the highest value of the valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider, (y) five (5) points more than the midpoint of the valuation range (expressed as a percentage of par) provided by the Independent Valuation Provider (provided that the value of such Unquoted Investment is customarily quoted as a percentage of par, otherwise this clause (y) shall not be applicable) and (z) 110% of the midpoint of the valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider; provided that, if a Portfolio Investment is acquired during a fiscal quarter and until such time as the Value is obtained with respect to such Portfolio Investment pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A), 5.12(b)(ii)(B) or 5.12(b)(iii), the “Value” of such Portfolio Investment shall be deemed to be equal to the lower of (x) the value of such Portfolio Investment determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) and (y) the cost of such Unquoted Investment.  

(iv)	Supplemental Testing of Values.

(A)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent individually or at the request of the Required Lenders, shall, at any time, have the right to request, in its reasonable discretion, any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base with a value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) to be independently tested by the Independent Valuation Provider.  There shall be no limit on the number of such tests that may be requested by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion.  If (x) the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is less than the value determined by the Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to this clause, then the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall continue to be used as the “Value” for purposes of this Agreement and (y) if the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is greater than the value determined by the Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to this clause and the difference between such values is:  (1) less than or equal to 5% of the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the value 

117

 

determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall continue to be used as the “Value” of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement; (2) greater than 5% and less than or equal to 20% of the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the “Value” of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement shall become the average of the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) and the value determined by the Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to this clause; and (3) greater than 20% of the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, shall retain an additional third-party appraiser and, upon the completion of such appraisal, the “Value” of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement shall become the average of the three (3) valuations (with the average of the Independent Valuation Provider’s value and the Borrower’s value determined pursuant to this clause to be used as the “Value” of such Portfolio Investment for a period of up to five (5) Business Days following written notice from the Administrative Agent of the “Value” determined pursuant to this clause and once such third-party appraiser has been retained and until the earlier of (x) the date such third value is obtained and (y) the immediately subsequent Valuation Testing Date, provided that if such third value is not obtained by the subsequent Valuation Testing Date, the “Value” of such Portfolio Investment shall be the Independent Valuation Provider’s Value until such Portfolio Investment is revalued in accordance with this Section 5.12). For the avoidance of doubt, Portfolio Investments that are part of the Collateral but not included in the Borrowing Base as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date or at any time between the applicable Valuation Testing Date and the immediately preceding Valuation Testing Date (unless such Portfolio Investment is no longer in the Collateral Pool pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder) shall not be subject to testing under this Section 5.12(b)(iv).

(B)	Except as otherwise provided herein, the Value of any Portfolio Investment for which the Independent Valuation Provider’s value is used shall be the midpoint of the range (if any) determined by the Independent Valuation Provider.  The Independent Valuation Provider shall apply a recognized valuation methodology that is commonly accepted by the business development company industry for valuing Portfolio Investments of the type being valued and held by the Obligors.

(C)	For the avoidance of doubt, the Value of any Portfolio Investment determined in accordance with this Section 5.12 shall be the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement until a new Value for such Portfolio Investment is subsequently determined in accordance with this Section 5.12.

(D)	The reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of any valuation reasonably incurred by the Administrative Agent, under this Section 5.12 shall be at the expense of the Borrower; provided that the Borrower’s obligation to reimburse valuation costs incurred by the Administrative Agent, pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(iv) shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal 

118

 

to the greater of (x) $100,000 and (y) 0.015% of the total Commitments for any 12-month period (the “IVP Supplemental Cap”).

(E)	In addition, the values determined by the Independent Valuation Provider shall be deemed to be “Information” hereunder and subject to Section 9.13 hereof.

(F)	The Administrative Agent shall provide a copy of the final results of any valuation performed by the Independent Valuation Provider or an Approved Third-Party Appraiser to any Lender promptly upon such Lender’s request, except to the extent that such recipient has not executed and delivered a customary and reasonable non-reliance letter, confidentiality agreement or similar agreement requested or required by such Independent Valuation Provider or Approved Third-Party Appraiser, as applicable; provided, that without the consent of the Borrower, no final report may be provided by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders prior to the earlier of the date that the Borrower delivers its financial statements for the related period and the date on which the Borrower is required to so deliver such financial statements pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b).

(v)	For the avoidance of doubt, any Values determined by the Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to Sections 5.12(b)(iii) and (iv) shall only be required to be used for purposes of calculating the Borrowing Base and shall not be required to be utilized by the Borrower for any other purpose, including, without limitation, the delivery of financial statements or valuations required under ASC 820 or the Investment Company Act.

(vi)	The Independent Valuation Provider shall be instructed to conduct its tests in a manner not disruptive in any material respect to the business of the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of its receipt of the final results of any valuation performed by the Independent Valuation Provider promptly upon its receipt thereof and shall provide a copy of such results and the related report to the Borrower promptly upon the Borrower’s request.

(c)	Investment Company Diversification Requirements.  The Borrower will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, at all times, comply in all material respects with the portfolio diversification and similar requirements set forth in the Investment Company Act applicable to business development companies. The Borrower will at all times, subject to applicable grace or cure periods set forth in the Code, comply with the portfolio diversification and similar requirements set forth in the Code applicable to RICs.

(d)	Participation Interests.  The Value attributable to any Participation Interest shall be the Value determined with respect to the underlying portfolio investment related to such Participation Interest in accordance with this Section 5.12, provided any participation interest that does not satisfy the definition of Participation Interest shall have a Value of zero for purposes of this Agreement.

 

119

 

SECTION 5.13.	Calculation of Borrowing Base.  For purposes of this Agreement, the “Borrowing Base” shall be determined, as at any date of determination, as the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (x) the Value of each Portfolio Investment in the Collateral Pool to the extent the Borrower elects to include such Portfolio Investment in the Borrowing Base by (y) the applicable Advance Rate, provided that:

(a)	if, as of such date, the Relevant Asset Coverage Ratio is (i) greater than or equal to 2.00:1.00, the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 6% of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base, shall be 50% of the otherwise applicable Advance Rate; (ii) less than 2.00:1.00 and greater than or equal to 1.75:1.00, the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 5% of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base, shall be 50% of the otherwise applicable Advance Rate; or (iii) less than 1.75:1.00, the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 4% of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base, shall be 50% of the otherwise applicable Advance Rate;

(b)	if, as of such date, the Relevant Asset Coverage Ratio is (i) greater than or equal to 2.00:1.00, the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 12% of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base shall be 0%; (ii) less than 2.00:1.00 and greater than or equal to 1.75:1.00, the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 10% of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base shall be 0%; or (iii) less than 1.75:1.00, the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 8% of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base shall be 0%;

120

 

Value of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base shall the Advance Rate applicable to such excess portion be 0%; (ii) less than 2.00:1.00 and greater than or equal to 1.75:1.00, the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base in any single Industry Classification Group that exceeds 20% of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base shall be 0%; provided that, with respect to the Portfolio Investments in a single Industry Classification Group from time to time designated by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this clause (ii), such 20% figure shall be increased to 25% and, accordingly, only to the extent that the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base in such single Industry Classification Group exceeds 25% of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base shall the Advance Rate applicable to such excess portion be 0%; or (iii) less than 1.75:1.00, the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base in any single Industry Classification Group that exceeds 20% of the aggregate Value of all Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base shall be 0%;

(e)	the Advance Rate applicable to CLO Securities (or other investments that similarly represent an investment in underlying levered portfolios), finance leases and investments in Excluded Assets, shall be 0%;

(h)	if (i)(A) the Borrowing Base (without giving effect to any adjustment required pursuant to this paragraph (h), the “Gross Borrowing Base”) is less than 1.50 times the Senior Debt Amount, and (B) the Relevant Asset Coverage Ratio is less than 

121

 

2.00:1.00 and greater than or equal to 1.75:1.00, the aggregate Borrowing Value of investments in Senior Investments may not be less than 60% of the Covered Debt Amount; (ii)(A) the Gross Borrowing Base is less than 1.50 times the Senior Debt Amount and (B) the Relevant Asset Coverage Ratio is less than 1.75:1.00, the aggregate Borrowing Value of investments in Senior Investments may not be less than 75% of the Covered Debt Amount; or (iii)(A) the Gross Borrowing Base is greater than or equal to 1.50 times the Senior Debt Amount, and (B) the Relevant Asset Coverage Ratio is less than 1.75:1.00, the aggregate Borrowing Value of investments in Senior Investments may not be less than 25% of the Covered Debt Amount (this provision referred to herein as the “Senior Investment Minimum Covenant”); and

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the failure to Deliver any Portfolio Investment or other Collateral shall not be a Default or Event of Default, except for any failure that would constitute an Event of Default under clause (p) of Article VII.

As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:

122

1 For the avoidance of doubt, the above categories are intended to be indicative of the traditional investment types.  All determinations of whether a particular Portfolio Investment belongs to one category or another shall be made by the Borrower on a consistent basis with the foregoing.

“Bank Loans” means debt obligations (including, without limitation, term loans, revolving loans, debtor-in-possession financings, the funded and unfunded portion of revolving 

123

 

credit lines and letter of credit facilities and other similar loans and investments including interim loans, bridge loans and senior subordinated loans) which are generally documented under documentation substantially similar to documents used under a syndicated loan or credit facility or pursuant to any loan agreement, note purchase agreement or other similar financing arrangement facility, whether or not syndicated.

“Bankruptcy Code” means the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq.

“Capital Stock” of any Person means any and all shares of corporate stock (however designated) of, and any and all other equity interests and participations representing ownership interests (including membership interests and limited liability company interests) in, such Person.

“Cash” has the meaning assigned to such term in Section 1.01 of this Agreement.

“Cash Equivalents” has the meaning assigned to such term in Section 1.01 of this Agreement.

“Cash Pay Bank Loans” means First Lien Bank Loans, First Lien Unitranche Bank Loans, First Lien Last Out Bank Loans, Late-Stage Loans and Second Lien Bank Loans as to which, at the time of determination, cash interest in an amount greater than or equal to the greater of (a) 2.00% above Term Benchmark or other similar floating rate (or, in each case, the replacement rate) per annum and (b) 3.00% per annum is payable for the most recent payment date (which shall be at least quarterly).

“First Lien Bank Loan” means a Bank Loan that is entitled to the benefit of a first lien and first-priority perfected security interest (subject to any Permitted Prior Working Capital Lien and other customary encumbrances) on a substantial portion of the assets (subject to customary exceptions) of the respective borrower and guarantors obligated in respect thereof; provided that any First Lien Bank Loan that is also a First Lien Unitranche Bank Loan shall be treated for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate as a First Lien Unitranche Bank Loan; provided further that any First Lien Bank Loan that is also a First Lien Last Out Bank Loan shall be treated for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate as a First Lien Last Out Bank Loan; provided further that any First Lien Bank Loan that is also a Late-Stage Loan shall be treated for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate as a Late-Stage Loan. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that, and only for so long as, any Permitted Prior Working Capital Lien exceeds the amount permitted under clause (c) of the definition thereof, an Obligor’s investment in such applicable Bank Loan shall be treated as a Second Lien Bank Loan for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate for such Portfolio Investment under this Agreement.

“First Lien Last Out Bank Loan” means a Bank Loan that is a First Lien Bank Loan, a portion of which is, in effect, subject to debt subordination following an event of default and superpriority rights of other lenders (such portion, a “last out” portion); provided, that the aggregate principal amount of the “last out” portion of such Bank Loan is at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of any “first out” portion of such Bank Loan; provided, further that 

124

 

(other than for a Late-Stage Loan) the underlying obligor with respect to such Bank Loan shall have a ratio of first lien debt (including the “first out” portion of such Bank Loan, but excluding the “last out” portion of such Bank Loan, and, solely to the extent such amounts are netted from debt in the debt to EBITDA calculation in the underlying documentation for such First Lien Bank Loan, net of any cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA that does not exceed 3.25:1.00 and a ratio of aggregate first lien debt (including both the “first out” portion and the “last out” portion of such Bank Loan, and, solely to the extent such amounts are netted from debt in the debt to EBITDA calculation in the underlying documentation for such First Lien Bank Loan, net of any cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA that does not exceed 5.25:1.00. An Obligor’s investment in the “last out” portion of a First Lien Last Out Bank Loan shall be treated as a First Lien Last Out Bank Loan for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate for such Portfolio Investment under this Agreement.

For purposes of this Section 6.04, the aggregate amount of an Investment at any time shall be deemed to be equal to (A) the aggregate amount of cash, together with the aggregate fair market value of property, loaned, advanced, contributed, transferred or otherwise invested that gives rise to such Investment (calculated at the time such Investment is made) minus (B) the aggregate amount of dividends, distributions or other payments received in cash in respect of such Investment; provided that in no event shall the aggregate amount of such Investment be deemed to be less than zero; provided further that the amount of an Investment shall not in any event be reduced by reason of any write-off of such Investment nor increased by any increase in the amount of earnings retained in such Investment or as a result of any other matter (other than any cash or assets contributed by or invested in such Investment).

SECTION 6.05.	Restricted Payments.  The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any other Obligor to, declare or make, or agree to pay or make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment, except that the Borrower may declare and pay:

(a)	dividends and distributions in either case in cash or other property (excluding for this purpose the Borrower’s common stock) in or with respect to any taxable year (or any calendar year, as relevant) of the Borrower in amounts not to exceed 110% of the higher of (x) the net investment income of the Borrower for the applicable year determined in accordance with GAAP and as specified in the annual financial statements most recently delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) and (y) the amount that is estimated in good faith by the Borrower to (i) satisfy the minimum distribution requirements imposed by Section 852(a) of the Code (or any successor thereto) to maintain the Borrower’s eligibility to be taxed as a RIC for any such taxable year, (ii) reduce to zero for any such taxable year the Borrower’s liability for federal income taxes imposed on (x) the Borrower’s investment company taxable income pursuant to Section 852(b)(1) of the Code (or any successor thereto), and (y) the Borrower’s net capital gain pursuant to Section 852(b)(3) of the Code (or any successor thereto), and (iii) reduce to zero the Borrower’s liability for federal excise taxes for such calendar year (or for the previous calendar year) imposed by Section 4982 of the Code (or any successor thereto);

(b)	other Restricted Payments so long as on the date of such other Restricted Payment and immediately after giving effect thereto and to any Concurrent Transactions, (A) no Borrowing Base Deficiency exists and the Covered Debt Amount does not exceed 90% of the Adjusted Gross Borrowing Base and (B) no Specified Default shall have occurred and be continuing; 

(c)	dividends with respect to the capital stock of the Borrower to the extent payable in additional shares of the Borrower’s common stock; and

In calculating the amount of Restricted Payments made during any period referred to in paragraph (b) above, any Restricted Payments made by any Designated Subsidiary or any other Excluded Asset that is a Subsidiary during such period (other than any such Restricted 

137

 

Payments that are made directly or indirectly to Obligors) shall be treated as Restricted Payments made by the Borrower during such period.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the payment of Restricted Payments by any Subsidiary Guarantor of the Borrower to (i) the Borrower or to any other Subsidiary Guarantor or (ii) on a pro rata basis, any class of its equityholders.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall not declare any dividend to the extent such declaration violates the provisions of the Investment Company Act applicable to it and the determination of the amounts referred to in paragraph (a) above shall be made separately for the taxable year and the calendar year and the limitation on dividends or distributions imposed by such paragraph shall apply separately to the amounts so determined.

SECTION 6.06.	Certain Restrictions on Subsidiaries.  The Borrower will not permit any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Excluded Asset or Immaterial Subsidiaries, in each case, with respect to its assets) to enter into or suffer to exist any indenture, agreement, instrument or other arrangement (other than (i) the Loan Documents, (ii) any indenture, agreement, instrument or other arrangement entered into in connection with Indebtedness permitted hereby to the extent any such indenture, agreement, instrument or other arrangement does not prohibit, in each case in any material respect, or impose materially adverse conditions upon, the requirements applicable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than any Excluded Asset or Immaterial Subsidiaries) under the Loan Documents or (iii) any agreement, instrument or other arrangement pertaining to any lease, sale or other disposition of any asset permitted by this Agreement so long as the applicable restrictions (A) only apply to such assets and (B) do not restrict prior to the consummation of such sale or disposition the creation or existence of the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Documents or otherwise required by this Agreement, or the incurrence or payment of Indebtedness under this Agreement or the ability of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than any Excluded Asset or Immaterial Subsidiaries) to perform any other obligation under any of the Loan Documents) that prohibits or restrains, in each case in any material respect, or imposes materially adverse conditions upon, the incurrence or payment of Indebtedness, the granting of Liens, the declaration or payment of dividends, the making of loans, advances, guarantees or Investments or the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of property.

SECTION 6.07.	Certain Financial Covenants.

The Borrower will not permit its Shareholders’ Equity at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than the greater of (i) $65,000,000 and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of (a) $65,000,000 plus (b) 65% of the net cash proceeds of the sale of equity interests of the Borrower after the Effective Date (other than proceeds of any distribution or dividend reinvestment plan) for each such sale that occurs at any time when Shareholders’ Equity is less than $750,000,000 plus (c) at any time when Shareholders’ Equity is greater than or equal to $750,000,000, (1) 25% of the net cash proceeds of the sale of equity interests of the Borrower after the Effective Date (other than proceeds of any distribution or dividend reinvestment plan) minus (2) the sum of (A) 25% of the aggregate amount paid or distributed by the Borrower to purchase its shares of common stock in connection with tender offers after the Effective 

138

 

Date plus (B) 25% of the sum of the Redemption Amount for each quarterly period since the Effective Date.

SECTION 6.09.	Lines of Business.  The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, engage in any business in a manner that would violate the Borrower’s Investment Policies in any material respect.

SECTION 6.10.	  No Further Negative Pledge.  The Borrower will not, and will not permit any other Obligor to, enter into any agreement, instrument, deed or lease which prohibits or limits in any material respect the ability of such Obligor to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its properties, assets or revenues, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or which requires the grant of any security for an obligation if security is granted for another obligation, except the following:  (a) this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (b) covenants in documents creating Liens permitted by Section 6.02 (including covenants with respect to Designated Indebtedness Obligations or Designated Indebtedness Holders under (and in each case, as defined in) the Guarantee and Security Agreement) prohibiting further Liens on the assets encumbered thereby; (c) customary restrictions contained in leases not subject to a waiver; (d) any agreement with a financier to an Excluded Asset that imposes such restrictions only on ownership and economic interests in such Excluded Asset; (e) 

139

 

the underlying governing agreements of any minority Equity Interest that impose such restrictions only on such Equity Interest; (f) any other agreement that does not restrict in any manner (directly or indirectly) Liens created pursuant to the Loan Documents on any Collateral securing the Secured Obligations and does not require (other than pursuant to a grant of a Lien under the Loan Documents) the direct or indirect granting of any Lien securing any Indebtedness or other obligation by virtue of the granting of Liens on or pledge of property of such Obligor to secure the Loans, or any Hedging Agreement and (g) any such agreement that imposes restrictions on Liens in joint venture investments (solely to the extent such restrictions relate to joint venture investments).

SECTION 6.11.	Modifications of Certain Documents. The Borrower will not consent to any modification, supplement or waiver of:

(a)	any of the provisions of any agreement, instrument or other document evidencing or relating to any Permitted Indebtedness, any Special Longer-Term Unsecured Indebtedness or any Shorter-Term Unsecured Indebtedness that would result in such Indebtedness not meeting the requirements of the definition of “Permitted Indebtedness”, “Special Longer-Term Unsecured Indebtedness” or “Shorter-Term Unsecured Indebtedness”, as applicable, set forth in Section 1.01 of this Agreement, in each case, unless following such amendment, modification or waiver, such Indebtedness would be permitted to be incurred under Section 6.01 if newly incurred as of such date; or

(b)	any of the Affiliate Agreements or the Custodian Agreements, unless such modification, supplement or waiver is not materially less favorable to the Borrower than could be obtained on an arm’s length basis from unrelated third parties. 

Without limiting the foregoing, the Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, freely amend, restate, terminate, or otherwise modify any documents, instruments and agreements evidencing, securing or relating to Indebtedness permitted pursuant to Section 6.01(d), including increases in the principal amount thereof, modifications to the advance rates and/or modifications to the interest rate, fees or other pricing terms so long as following any such action such Indebtedness continues to be permitted under Section 6.01(d).

SECTION 6.12.	Payments of Other Indebtedness.  The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any other Obligor to, purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value, or set apart any money for a sinking, defeasance or other analogous fund for the purchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition of, or make any voluntary payment or prepayment of the principal of or interest on, or any other amount owing in respect of, any Permitted Indebtedness, any Special Longer-Term Unsecured Indebtedness, any Shorter-Term Unsecured Indebtedness or any Indebtedness that is not then included in the Covered Debt Amount (other than (x) payments and prepayments of Contingent Secured Indebtedness and (y) the refinancing of such Indebtedness with Indebtedness permitted under Section 6.01 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as incurred by an Excluded Asset or other Subsidiary) or with the proceeds of any issuance of Equity Interests of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries), except for:

140

 

(a)	regularly scheduled payments, prepayments or redemptions of principal and interest in respect thereof required pursuant to the instruments evidencing such Indebtedness and the payment when due of the types of fees and expenses that are customarily paid in connection with such Indebtedness (it being understood that: (i) the conversion features into Permitted Equity Interests under convertible notes; (ii) the triggering of such conversion and/or settlement thereof solely with Permitted Equity Interests; (iii) any cash payment on account of interest or expenses or fractional shares on such convertible notes in respect of such triggering and/or settlement thereof, and (iv) any customary mandatory prepayment provisions required by the terms thereof, shall be permitted under this clause (a)); 

(b)	payments and prepayments thereof required to comply with requirements of Section 2.10(c) or 2.10(d);

(d)	any payments and prepayments with respect to any Permitted Advisor Loan so long as, (i) at the time of and immediately after giving effect to such payment or prepayment, as applicable, and any Concurrent Transactions, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the Adjusted Gross Borrowing Base immediately after giving effect to such payment or prepayment, as applicable, is at least 115% of the Covered Debt Amount;

provided that, in no event shall any Obligor be permitted to prepay or settle (whether as a result of a mandatory redemption, conversion or otherwise) any such Indebtedness, if immediately after giving effect thereto and to any Concurrent Transactions, the Covered Debt Amount would exceed the Borrowing Base; provided further that, no Obligor shall be permitted to give any notice of prepayment or redemption to any holders of Indebtedness not included in the Covered Debt Amount, if at the time of the giving of such notice, the inclusion of such Indebtedness in the Covered Debt Amount, after giving effect to any Concurrent Transactions, would result in a Borrowing Base Deficiency.

(d)	the Borrower shall fail to observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement contained in (i) Section 5.03 (with respect to the Borrower’s existence), Sections 5.08(a) and (b), Section 5.09 (solely with respect to a violation of applicable Sanctions), or in Article VI or any Obligor shall default in the performance of any of its obligations contained in Section 7 of the Guarantee and Security Agreement, or (ii) Sections 5.01(d) and (e), or Section 5.02 and such failure, in the case of this clause (ii), shall continue unremedied for a period of five or more Business Days after notice thereof by the Administrative Agent (given at the request of any Lender) to the Borrower; provided that to the extent failure of an Obligor to “Deliver” (as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) any particular Investment to the extent required by Section 7 of the Guarantee and Security Agreement would not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 7.01(p) (assuming such investments were included in the Collateral Pool), such failure to Deliver shall not constitute a Default under this clause (d);

142

 

(e)	a Borrowing Base Deficiency shall occur and continue unremedied for a period of five or more Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrating such Borrowing Base Deficiency pursuant to Section 5.01(e); provided that it shall not be a Specified Default or an Event of Default hereunder if the Borrower shall present the Administrative Agent with a reasonably feasible plan to enable such Borrowing Base Deficiency to be cured within 30 Business Days (which 30-Business Day period shall include the five Business Days permitted for delivery of such plan), so long as such Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured within such 30-Business Day period; provided further, such 30-Business Day period shall be extended to a 45-Business Day period solely to the extent as provided in Section 2.10(c) in order to cure any failure to satisfy the Senior Investment Minimum Covenant;

(h)	any event or condition occurs that (i) results in any Material Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or (ii) shall continue unremedied for any applicable period of time sufficient to enable or permit the holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness or any trustee or agent on its or their behalf to, as a result of an event of default under such Material Indebtedness, cause any Material Indebtedness to become due, or to require the prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance thereof, prior to its scheduled maturity (for the avoidance of doubt, in each case, other than as permitted under Section 6.12 and that is not a result of a breach, default or other violation or failure in respect of such Material Indebtedness by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and after giving effect to any applicable grace or cure period), provided that this clause (h) shall not apply (1) to secured Indebtedness that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale or transfer of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness, (2) to convertible debt that becomes due as a result of a conversion or redemption event, other than as a result of an “event of default” (as defined in the documents governing such convertible Material Indebtedness), (3) to any Indebtedness of a Designated Subsidiary that becomes due in part as a result of a breach of an overcollateralization test or borrowing base deficiency, or a customary “change of control” put right in any indenture or (4) in the case of clause (h)(ii), to any Indebtedness of a Designated Subsidiary (x) to the extent the event or condition giving rise to the circumstances in clause (h)(ii) was not a payment or insolvency default or (y) so long as all Commitments have not been terminated and the Loans have not been declared due and payable in full, such event or condition is no longer continuing or has been waived in accordance with the terms of such Material Indebtedness such that the holder or holders thereof or any trustee or agent 

143

 

on its or their behalf are no longer enabled or permitted to cause such Material Indebtedness to become due, or to require the prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance thereof, prior to its scheduled maturity;

(i)	an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an involuntary petition shall be filed seeking (i) liquidation, reorganization or other relief in respect of the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or group of Subsidiaries that if consolidated would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) or its debts, or of a substantial part of its assets, under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (or group of Subsidiaries that if consolidated would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) or for a substantial part of its assets, and, in any such case, such proceeding or petition shall continue undismissed and unstayed for a period of 60 or more days or an order or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered;

145

 

terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; and in case of any event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (i) or (j) of this Article VII, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

In the event that the Loans shall be declared, or shall become, due and payable pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph then, upon notice from the Administrative Agent or Lenders with LC Exposure representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure of a Class demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall immediately deposit into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account cash in an amount equal to 102% of the LC Exposure of such Class as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (i) or (j) of this Article VII.

ARTICLE VIII

THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent as the collateral agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Collateral Agent to have all the rights and benefits hereunder and thereunder (including Section 9 of the Guarantee and Security Agreement), and to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, make investments in and generally engage in any kind of business trust or other business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and such Person and its Affiliates may accept fees and 

146

 

other consideration from the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to the other Lenders.

The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any e-mail, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related 

147

 

Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent may resign by providing not less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower.  Upon any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in consultation with the Borrower), to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation shall nonetheless become effective at the end of such thirty (30) day period, except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02(b) with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Loan Documents; provided that, without the prior consent of each Lender, the Administrative Agent shall not (except as provided herein or in the Security Documents) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under any Security Document providing for collateral security, agree to additional obligations being secured by all 

148

 

or substantially all of such collateral security (except in connection with securing additional obligations equally and ratably with the Loans and other obligations hereunder in accordance with the Guarantee and Security Agreement) , or alter or subordinate the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the benefits of the Liens created under the Security Documents with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral, except that no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, to (1) release (which such release shall be automatic and require no further action from any party) any Lien covering property that is the subject of either a disposition of property permitted hereunder or a disposition to which the Required Lenders have consented, (2) release from any Guarantee and Security Agreement any “Subsidiary Guarantor” (and any property of such Subsidiary Guarantor) that is designated as a “Designated Subsidiary” by the Borrower or becomes an Excluded Asset or an Immaterial Subsidiary in accordance with this Agreement or which is no longer required to be a “Subsidiary Guarantor”, so long as in the case of this clause (2): (A) immediately after giving effect to any such release and any Concurrent Transactions, the Covered Debt Amount does not exceed the Borrowing Base and the Borrower delivers a certificate of a Financial Officer to such effect to the Administrative Agent, (B) either, immediately after giving effect to any Concurrent Transactions, (I) the amount of any excess availability under the Borrowing Base immediately prior to such release is not diminished as a result of such release or (II) the Adjusted Gross Borrowing Base immediately after giving effect to such release is at least 110% of the Covered Debt Amount and (C) no Specified Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (3) spread Liens to any Designated Indebtedness or Hedging Agreement Obligations (as such terms are defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) in accordance with the Guarantee and Security Agreement and (4) release from any Guarantee and Security Agreement any Obligor (and any property of such Obligor) that is concurrently being joined as an Obligor under the Guarantee and Security Agreement in connection with a transaction permitted hereunder.

None of the Lead Arrangers shall have obligations or duties whatsoever in such capacity under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and shall incur no liability hereunder or thereunder in such capacity, but all such persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder.

Each Lender and Issuing Bank hereby agrees that (x) if the Administrative Agent notifies such Lender or Issuing Bank that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Lender or Issuing Bank from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees or otherwise; individually and collectively, a “Payment”) were erroneously transmitted to such Lender or Issuing Bank (whether or not known to such Lender or Issuing Bank), and demands the return of such Payment (or a portion thereof), such Lender or Issuing Bank shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender or Issuing Bank to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect, and (y) to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to the Administrative Agent, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with 

149

 

respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Payments received, including without limitation any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

Each Lender and Issuing Bank hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a “Payment Notice”) or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment Notice, it shall be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to such Payment.  Each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees that, in each such case, or if it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such occurrence and, upon demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender or Issuing Bank to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect.

The Borrower and each other Obligor hereby agrees that (x) in the event an erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) are not recovered from any Lender or Issuing Bank that has received such Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Lender or Issuing Bank with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Obligor; provided that this paragraph shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the Secured Obligations of the Borrower relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the Secured Obligations that would have been payable had such erroneous Payment not been made by the Administrative Agent, except, in each case, to the extent such Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any other Obligor for the purpose of making any payment hereunder.

Each party’s obligations pursuant to the foregoing shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, an Issuing Bank, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

Each of the Administrative Agent and any Lender agree that the obligations assumed by any Obligor hereunder shall be limited in all cases to such Obligor and its assets and none of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective agents or assigns shall seek satisfaction of any such obligation from the officers, agents, employees, directors, trustees, managers, members, shareholders or partners of any such Obligor.

Any party hereto may change its address, telecopy number or e-mail address for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto.  All notices and other 

152

 

communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.  Notices delivered through electronic communications to the extent provided in paragraph (b) below, shall be effective as provided in said paragraph (b).

(b)	Electronic Communications.  Notices and other communications to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender or any Issuing Bank pursuant to Article II if such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication.  The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.  Unless otherwise notified by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, the Borrower may satisfy its obligations to deliver documents or notices to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under Sections 5.01 and 5.02 by delivering an electronic copy to:  kevin.c.campbell@chase.com and gina.yant@chase.com, or such other e-mail address(es) as provided to the Borrower in a notice from the Administrative Agent, (and the Administrative Agent shall promptly provide notice thereof to the Lenders).

Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement); provided that if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor.

In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any Lender have any liability to the Borrower or any other Person for damages of any kind (whether in tort contract or otherwise) arising out of any transmission of communications through the internet, except in the case of direct damages, to the extent such damages are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of such relevant Person.

(c)	Documents to be Delivered under Sections 5.01 and 5.02.  For so long as an Intralinks™ or equivalent website is available to each of the Lenders hereunder, the Borrower may satisfy its obligation to deliver documents to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under Sections 5.01 and 5.02 by delivering either an electronic copy in the manner specified in Section 9.01(b) or a notice identifying the website where such information is located for posting by the Administrative Agent on Intralinks™ or such equivalent website; provided that the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility to maintain access to Intralinks™ or an equivalent website.

153

 

SECTION 9.02.	Waivers; Amendments.

(a)	No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative.  No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 9.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

(b)	Amendments to this Agreement.  Subject to Sections 2.15(b), (c) and (d) and Section 9.02(e) below, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, no such agreement shall:

(i)	increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender,

(ii)	reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon (other than with respect to the election of or the failure to elect the default rate in accordance with Section 2.12(d)), or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby,

(iii)	postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby,

(iv)	change Section 2.18(b), (c) or (d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender directly adversely affected thereby, 

(v)	change any of the provisions of this Section 9.02 (b) or the definition of the term “Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, 

154

 

(vi)	other than as permitted by this Agreement, the Guarantee and Security Agreement or any other applicable Loan Document, release or subordinate all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Lien created under the Guarantee and Security Agreement or release all or substantially all of the Obligors from their obligations as Subsidiary Guarantors thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, or

(vii)	amend the definition of “Applicable Percentage”, “Applicable Dollar Percentage” or “Applicable Multicurrency Percentage”, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

provided further that (x) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank  or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be and (y) the consent of Lenders holding not less than two-thirds of the holders of the total Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments will be required (A) for any adverse change (from the Lenders’ perspective) affecting the provisions of this Agreement solely relating to the calculation of the Borrowing Base (excluding changes to the provisions of Section 5.12(b)(iii) or (iv), but including changes to the provisions of Section 5.12(c) and the definitions set forth in Section 5.13) unless otherwise expressly provided herein and (B) for any release of Collateral other than for fair value or as otherwise permitted hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.

For purposes of this Section 9.02, the “scheduled date of payment” of any amount shall refer to the date of payment of such amount specified in this Agreement, and shall not refer to a date or other event specified for the mandatory or optional prepayment of such amount.  In addition, whenever a waiver, amendment or modification requires the consent of a Lender “affected” thereby, such waiver, amendment or modification shall, upon consent of such Lender, become effective as to such Lender whether or not it becomes effective as to any other Lender, so long as the Required Lenders consent to such waiver, amendment or modification as provided above.

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Lenders of any Class in a manner that does not affect all Classes equally shall be effective against the Lenders of such Class unless the Required Lenders of such Class shall have concurred with such waiver, amendment or modification as provided above; provided, however, in no other circumstances shall the concurrence of the Required Lenders of a particular Class be required for any waiver, amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

(c)	Amendments to Security Documents.  Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in the Guarantee and Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents, no Security Document nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified, nor may the Liens granted under the Guarantee and Security Agreement be spread to secure any additional obligations (excluding (x) any increase in the Loans and Letters of Credit hereunder pursuant to a Commitment Increase under Section 2.08(e), (y) any increase in any Other Secured Indebtedness permitted hereunder and (z) the spreading of such Liens to any Designated 

155

 

Indebtedness or Hedging Agreement Obligations (as such terms are defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) as provided for in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Collateral Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, except as otherwise expressly permitted by the Loan Documents, (i) without the written consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the Obligors from their respective obligations under the Security Documents and (ii) without the written consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the collateral security or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under the Security Documents, alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the Liens created under the Security Documents (except in connection with securing additional obligations equally and ratably with the Loans and other obligations hereunder) with respect to all or substantially all of the collateral security provided thereby, or release all or substantially all of the guarantors under the Guarantee and Security Agreement from their guarantee obligations thereunder, except that, in each case described in clause (i) or (ii), no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized (and so agrees with the Borrower) to direct the Collateral Agent under the Guarantee and Security Agreement (in addition to the rights of such parties under the Guarantee and Security Agreement), to and the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may, (1) release any Lien covering property (and to release any such guarantor) that is the subject of either a disposition of property (including, without limitation, any property subject to a participation or repurchase transaction or in connection with the origination of any CLO Security or any Back-to-Back Transaction) permitted hereunder or a disposition to which the Required Lenders or the required number or percentage of Lenders have consented (and such Lien shall be released automatically to the extent provided in the Guarantee and Security Agreement, which includes the automatic release of any Lien covering Collateral that is the subject of a disposition to a Person that is not an Obligor in a transaction not prohibited under this Agreement (including, without limitation, any asset subject to a participation interest or repurchase transaction not prohibited hereunder) and each then extant Designated Indebtedness Document), (2) release from the Guarantee and Security Agreement any “Subsidiary Guarantor” (and any property of such Subsidiary Guarantor) that is designated as a “Designated Subsidiary” or becomes an Excluded Asset or an Immaterial Subsidiary in accordance with this Agreement or is otherwise no longer required to be a “Subsidiary Guarantor” (including, without limitation, because it ceases to be consolidated on the Borrower’s financial statements), in each case pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder, so long as (A) immediately after giving effect to any such release under this clause (2) and any Concurrent Transactions, the Covered Debt Amount does not exceed the Borrowing Base and the Borrower delivers a certificate of a Financial Officer to such effect to the Administrative Agent, (B) immediately after giving effect to any Concurrent Transactions, either (I) the amount of any excess availability under the Borrowing Base immediately prior to such release is not diminished as a result of such release or (II) the Adjusted Gross Borrowing Base, immediately after giving effect to such release is at least 110% of the Covered Debt Amount and (C) no Specified Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

(d)	Replacement of Non-Consenting Lender.  If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, amendment, consent, discharge or termination to any of the provisions of this Agreement requiring (i) the consent of “each Lender” or “each Lender affected thereby” or (ii) the consent of “two-thirds of the holders of the total Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments” that has been approved by the Required Lenders, the consent of one or 

156

 

more Lenders whose consent is required for such proposed change, waiver, amendment, consent, discharge or termination is not obtained, then (so long as no Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing) the Borrower shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders with one or more replacement Lenders pursuant to Section 2.20(b) so long as at the time of such replacement, each such replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge, termination or addition.

(e)	If the Administrative Agent and the Borrower acting together identify any ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect in any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend, modify or supplement such provision to cure such ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect, and such amendment, modification or supplement shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.03.	Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

(a)	Costs and Expenses.  Subject to any limitation previously agreed in writing, the Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates (with respect to legal fees, limited to the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of one outside counsel for the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates collectively plus, if necessary, one single local counsel per appropriate jurisdiction) in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by each Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, (iii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender (with respect to legal fees, limited to the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of one outside counsel plus, if necessary, one local counsel per appropriate jurisdiction (and, in the case of an actual conflict of interest where the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender affected by such conflict informs the Borrower of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel, another firm of counsel for any such affected Person) for the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank and any Lender collectively), in connection with the enforcement or protection of such Person’s respective rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section 9.03, or in connection with the Loans or Letters of Credit, including all such documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof and (iv) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses, taxes, assessments and other charges incurred in connection with any filing, registration, recording or perfection of any security interest contemplated by any Security Document or any other document referred to therein limited in the case of legal expenses to the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of one outside counsel for the Collateral Agent .  For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall not be responsible for the reimbursement of any costs,

(b)	Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank, the Lead Arrangers and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (with respect to legal fees, limited to the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of one outside counsel plus, if necessary, one local counsel per appropriate jurisdiction (and, in the case of an actual conflict of interest where the Indemnitee affected by such conflict informs the Borrower of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel, another firm of counsel for any such affected Indemnitee) for the Indemnitees collectively (other than the allocated costs of internal counsel)), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder owed by or to or otherwise arising with respect to the Borrower or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby or pursuant to any other Loan Document, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by any Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit) or (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (A) the fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee, (B) the material breach of such Indemnitee’s obligations under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or (C) a claim arising as a result of a dispute between Indemnitees (other than (x) any dispute involving claims against the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, the Lead Arrangers or any Lender, in each case in their respective capacities as such, and (y) claims arising out of any act or omission by the Borrower or its Affiliates).  This Section 9.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.

(c)	Reimbursement by Lenders.  To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 9.03, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.

(d)	Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto shall assert, and each party hereto hereby waives, any claim against any other party (or any Related Party to such party), on any theory of liability, for 

158

 

special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof, provided that nothing contained in this sentence shall limit the Borrower’s indemnification obligations under Section 9.03 to the extent such special, indirect consequential or punitive damages are included in any third party claim in connection with which any Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification thereunder.  None of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank, the Lead Arrangers and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; except to the extent caused by fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank, Lead Arrangers and Lender, or Related Party, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(e)	Payments.  All amounts due under this Section 9.03 shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.

SECTION 9.04.	Successors and Assigns.

(a)	Assignments Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section 9.04 (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Lender which is not in accordance with this Section 9.04 shall be treated as provided in the last sentence of Section 9.04(b)(iii)).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b)	Assignments by Lenders.

(i)	Assignments Generally.  Subject to the conditions set forth in clause (ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (other than natural persons (or holding companies, investment vehicles or trusts for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of natural persons)) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans and LC Exposure at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:

159

 

(A)	the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (except that so long as no Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII is continuing, the Borrower shall have a consent right over any assignment to a Disqualified Lender), any other assignee; provided, further, that the Borrower’s consent will be deemed given with respect to a proposed assignment if no response is received within five (5) Business Days after having received a written request from the applicable Lender; and 

(B)	the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks holding LC Commitments of the same Class as the Commitment, Loans and LC Exposure being transferred.

(ii)	Certain Conditions to Assignments.  Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

(A)	except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans and LC Exposure of a Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans and LC Exposure of such Class of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than U.S. $5,000,000 unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing;

(B)	each partial assignment of any Class of Commitments or Loans and LC Exposure shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Class of Commitments, Loans and LC Exposure;

(C)	the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of U.S. $3,500 (which fee shall not be payable in connection with an assignment to a Lender or to an Affiliate of a Lender) (for which no Obligor shall be obligated); and

(D)	the assignee, if it shall not already be a Lender of the applicable Class, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

(iii)	Effectiveness of Assignments.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 9.04, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be 

160

 

released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment).  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section 9.04.

(c)	Maintenance of Register by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Registers shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Registers pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Registers shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  The Administrative Agent agrees to provide the Borrower with official copies of the Register upon reasonable request.

(d)	Acceptance of Assignments by Administrative Agent.  Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04 and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register.  No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph (d).

(e)	Participations.  Any Lender, with notice to the Borrower, may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities other than a Disqualified Lender (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (iv) no consent of the Borrower shall be required (except that so long as no Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII is continuing, the Borrower shall have a consent right over any participation to a Disqualified Lender).  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other 

161

 

Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section 9.04, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Sections 2.17(e), (f) and (g) (it being understood that the documentation required under these paragraphs shall be delivered to the participating Lender)). Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.20 with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender; provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(d) as though it were a Lender hereunder.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”) and shall not have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or Section 1.163-5(b) of the proposed United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

(f)	Limitations on Rights of Participants.  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17 as though it were a Lender and in the case of a Participant claiming exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, the applicable Lender shall provide the Borrower with satisfactory evidence that the participation is in registered form and shall permit the Borrower to review such register as reasonably needed for the Borrower to comply with its obligations under applicable laws and regulations.  

(g)	Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section 9.04 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a 

162

 

security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

(h)	No Assignments or Participations to Natural Persons, the Borrower or Affiliates or Certain Other Persons.  Anything in this Section 9.04 to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may (i) assign or participate any interest in any Loan or LC Exposure held by it hereunder to any natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned by and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person) or to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, Designated Subsidiaries) without the prior consent of each Lender or (ii) assign any interest in any Commitment, Loan or LC Exposure held by it hereunder to any Person known by such Lender at the time of such assignment to be a Defaulting Lender, a Subsidiary of a Defaulting Lender or a Person who, upon consummation of such assignment would be a Defaulting Lender.

(i)	Multicurrency Lenders.  Any assignment by a Multicurrency Lender, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, must be to a Person that is able to fund and receive payments on account of each outstanding Agreed Foreign Currency at such time without the need to obtain any authorization from the central bank or other Governmental Authority in the country of issue of such Foreign Currency.

(j)	Certain Matters Relating to Disqualified Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Lenders.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender is a Disqualified Lender or (y) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Loans, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Disqualified Lender.  The list of Disqualified Lenders will be made available by the Administrative Agent to any Lender, Participant or potential Lender or participant upon request.

SECTION 9.05.	Survival.  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.  The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  

163

 

SECTION 9.06.	Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.

(a)	Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy or e-mail shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

(b)	Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in or related to any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation any Assignment and Assumption, amendments or other Borrowing Requests, waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures (including, for the avoidance of doubt, electronic signatures utilizing the DocuSign platform) or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

SECTION 9.07.	Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 9.08.	Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each Issuing Bank and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever Currency) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document held by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured, or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or 

164

 

obligated on such Indebtedness of the Borrower.  The rights of each Lender, each Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates under this Section 9.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Affiliate may have; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender exercises any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off will be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.19 and, pending such payment, will be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders and (b) the Defaulting Lender will provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided further, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

SECTION 9.09.	Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.

(a)	Governing Law.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

(b)	Submission to Jurisdiction.  Each party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York sitting in New York County, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

(c)	Waiver of Venue.  Each party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 9.09.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

(d)	Service of Process.  Each party to this Agreement (i) irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01 and (ii) agrees to the extent permitted by applicable law that service as provided in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01 is sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over such party in any proceeding in any court and otherwise constitutes effective and binding service in every respect.  Nothing in this 

165

 

Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

SECTION 9.10.	WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

SECTION 9.11.	Judgment Currency.  This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of Dollars or any Foreign Currency, as the case may be (the “Specified Currency”), and payment in New York City or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case may be (the “Specified Place”), is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency.  The payment obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement shall not be discharged or satisfied by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder.  If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the “Second Currency”), the rate of exchange that shall be applied shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered.  The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document (in this Section 9.11 called an “Entitled Person”) shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due from the Borrower hereunder in the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and the Borrower hereby, and as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in the Specified Currency, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due from the Borrower to such Entitled Person in the Specified Currency hereunder exceeds the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred.

SECTION 9.12.	Headings.  Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and 

166

 

shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.  None of the Lead Arrangers shall have any responsibility under this Agreement.

SECTION 9.13.	Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality.

(a)	Treatment of Certain Information.  The Borrower acknowledges that from time to time financial advisory, investment banking and other services may be offered or provided to the Borrower or one or more of its Subsidiaries (in connection with this Agreement or otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more subsidiaries or affiliates of such Lender and the Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender to share any information delivered to such Lender by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such subsidiary or affiliate, it being understood that any such subsidiary or affiliate receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 9.13 as if it were a Lender hereunder.  Such authorization shall survive the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

(b)	Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arrangers, each Issuing Bank and each Lender agrees to keep confidential all Information (as defined below); provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arranger, any Issuing Bank or any Lender from disclosing any such Information (a) to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arranger, any Issuing Bank or any Lender or any Affiliate thereof that has been informed of the confidential nature of such information and advised of its obligation to keep information of this type confidential, (b) subject to an agreement to comply with the provisions of this Section, to any actual or prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement that has been approved by the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the extent the Borrower’s consent to an assignment in or participation acquired by such Person is required pursuant to Section 9.04(b) or (e), as applicable; provided that, such Person would be permitted to be an assignee or Participant pursuant to the terms hereof and (except with the prior written consent of the Borrower) such Person is not a Disqualified Lender, (c) to its employees, directors, agents, attorneys, accountants and other professional advisors or those of any of its Affiliates who are informed of the confidential nature of such information and advised of their obligation to keep information of this type confidential (collectively, “Representatives”), (d) upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority, (e) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (provided that, it will use its reasonable efforts to notify the Borrower in writing of any such disclosure prior to making such disclosure to the extent permitted by applicable law, rule or regulation and will use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of such information and will cooperate with the Borrower, at the Borrower’s expense, to the extent the Borrower may reasonably request in seeking to resist or limit such disclosure), (f) if requested or required to do so in connection with any litigation or similar proceeding, (g) that has been publicly disclosed, (h) to any self-regulatory authority, including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization that requires access to information about a Lender’s investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect to such Lender; provided that the disclosure of any such information to any such organization or agency referred to above shall 

167

 

be made subject to the acknowledgment and acceptance by such organization or agency that such information is being disseminated on a confidential basis in accordance with customary market standards for dissemination of such type of information, (i) in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (j) to any other party to this Agreement, (k) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any direct or indirect or prospective counterparty to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Transactions (or any professional advisor to such counterparty), (l) to any nationally recognized rating agency, (m) that becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any of their respective branches or Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower who did not acquire such information as a result of a breach of this Section or a breach of any other confidentiality obligations to the Borrower that is known by such disclosing party to be a breach of such other confidentiality obligations or (n) if agreed by the Borrower in its sole discretion, to any other Person.   For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from the Fidelity Advisor, Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses or any portfolio investment (including Portfolio Investments and including the Value of such Portfolio Investments), whether made orally, in writing, or by any other means whether tangible, intangible, electronic or observational, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arranger, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Fidelity Advisor, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 9.13(b) shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  In addition, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and each Lender may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to any market data collector or similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in connection with the administration or servicing of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Commitments.

No Lender shall, without first obtaining the Borrower’s express written consent: (x) use or permit the use of any Information for any purpose whatsoever except for the specific purposes of performing under this Agreement (other than as expressly provided in this Section 9.13); (y) disclose or permit the disclosure of any Information to any person or entity other than as specified above; and (z) disclose any Information to any other client (except to the extent permitted above) or Affiliate of such Lender or any Disqualified Lender. The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arranger, each Issuing Bank and each Lender shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives or its Affiliates.

The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arranger, each Issuing Bank or each Lender acknowledges that improper disclosure of Information may irreparably harm the Borrower.  Because money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, the Borrower shall be entitled to seek and obtain specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief on an emergency, temporary, preliminary and/or permanent basis, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, without first being required to demonstrate actual damages or post any security or bond.  Such remedy shall not be deemed to 

168

 

be the exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other legal, equitable or contractual remedies that the Borrower may have.

 

Each Lender acknowledges that information furnished to it pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities, and confirms that it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and that it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with those procedures and applicable law, including federal and state securities laws; provided that each Lender shall be responsible for its controlled Affiliates’ compliance with this Section 9.13(b).

 

All information, including requests for waivers and amendments, furnished by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to, or in the course of administering, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents will be syndicate-level information, which may contain material non-public information about the Borrower and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities. Accordingly, each Lender represents to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it has identified in its administrative questionnaire a credit contact who may receive information that may contain material non-public information in accordance with its compliance procedures and applicable law, including federal and state securities laws.

 

 

SECTION 9.14.	USA PATRIOT Act.  Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107‑56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with said Act.

SECTION 9.15.	Acknowledgment and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

(a)  the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and 

(b)  the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:

(i)  a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;

(ii)  a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such 

169

 

shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or

(iii)  the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.

SECTION 9.16.	No Fiduciary Duty.    Each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Lenders”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Obligors, their respective stockholders and/or their respective affiliates.  Each Obligor agrees that nothing in this Agreement or the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and such Obligor, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other.  The Obligors acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Obligors, on the other, and (ii) solely in connection therewith and solely with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Obligor, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Obligor, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to any Obligor except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender is acting hereunder solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any Obligor, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person.  Each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and the process leading thereto.  Each Obligor agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services in connection with the Loan Documents of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Obligor, solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or the process leading thereto.

SECTION 9.17.	Certain ERISA Matters.  (a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, and the Lead Arrangers and their respective Affiliates, that at least one of the following is and will be true:

(i)	such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of the Plan Asset Regulations) of one or more Benefit Plans in connection with the Loans, the Letters of Credit or the Commitments, 

(ii)	the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class 

170

 

exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to, such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement,

(iii)	(A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, or

(iv)	such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Lender.

(b)	In addition, unless sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or such Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant as provided in sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arrangers and their respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Obligor, that none of the Administrative Agent, or any Lead Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates is a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related to hereto or thereto).

(c)	The Administrative Agent and the Lead Arrangers hereby inform the Lenders that each such Person is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and that such Person has a financial interest in the transactions contemplated hereby in that such Person or an Affiliate thereof (i) may receive interest or other payments with respect to the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement and any other Loan Document, (ii) may recognize a gain if it extended the Loans, the Letters of Credit, or the Commitments for an amount less than the amount being paid for an interest in the Loans, the Letters of Credit or the Commitments by such Lender or (iii) may receive fees or other payments in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the Loan Documents or otherwise, including structuring fees, commitment fees, arrangement fees, facility fees, upfront fees, underwriting fees, ticking fees, agency fees, administrative agent or collateral agent fees, utilization fees, minimum usage fees, letter of credit fees, fronting fees, deal-away or alternate 

171

 

transaction fees, amendment fees, processing fees, term out premiums, banker’s acceptance fees, breakage or other early termination fees or fees similar to the foregoing.

SECTION 9.18.	Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs.  To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedging Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support “QFC Credit Support” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):

In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

SECTION 9.19.	Termination.  Promptly upon the Facility Termination Date, the Administrative Agent shall direct the Collateral Agent to, on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, deliver to the Borrower such termination statements and releases and other documents necessary or appropriate to evidence the release of the Borrower from this Agreement, the Loan Documents and each of the documents securing the obligations of the Borrower (and, in the case of the Facility Termination Date, with respect to each of the foregoing, the termination thereof) hereunder as the Borrower may reasonably request, all at the cost and expense of the Borrower.
