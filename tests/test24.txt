Each Performance Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each of the Owners, the Funding Agents and the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Owners) (collectively, the “Guaranteed Parties”) to cause the due and punctual performance and observance of all the obligations, agreements and undertakings of the RCA Sellers, the RCA Purchaser, the RSA Seller, the Servicer and any Successor Servicer which is an Affiliate of the Servicer (each, a “Guarantee Party”), under the Related Documents to which such Guarantee Party is a party and each other document identified by such Performance Guarantor (in its sole discretion) in writing as a Guaranteed Document (collectively, the “Guaranteed Documents”) to be performed or observed by such Guarantee Party pursuant to the Guaranteed Documents (all such obligations, agreements and undertakings on the part of the Guarantee Parties to be performed or observed under the Guaranteed Documents being collectively called the “Guaranteed Obligations”). Without limiting or expanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Guaranteed Obligations shall not include, and each Performance Guarantor shall not guaranty or otherwise be liable to any Person for (w) any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (except to the extent the Guarantee Party would be liable to any such Guaranteed Party under a Guaranteed Document for such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses), (x) losses resulting from the performance or collectibility of the Receivables on account of insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the obligors, (y) the non-payment or late payment of any Receivable by the obligor thereof, or (z) any act, inaction, obligation or liability of the Transferor, the Administrative Agent, the Funding Agents or any other Person other than a Guarantee Party or the failure of any of them to fully and punctually pay, perform or comply with any of the terms, covenants, conditions, agreements, undertakings and obligations on the part of such Person to be paid, performed or complied with by it under any of the Related Documents, this Performance Guaranty or otherwise.

    2


made in connection with any proceedings involving a Guarantee Party or either Performance Guarantor filed under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, whether pursuant to Section 502 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other Section thereof), and (v) any other circumstance that would otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Performance Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent that a Guarantee Party on its own behalf pursuant to the Related Documents, makes a payment or payments to the Guaranteed Parties in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to its estate, trustee, receiver or any other party, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment or repayment, the Guaranteed Obligations or part thereof that has been paid, reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continue in full force and effect as of the date such initial payment, reduction or satisfaction occurred.
