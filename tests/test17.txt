(ii)    Notwithstanding any term hereof or elsewhere to the contrary, (a) it is hereby expressly acknowledged that (i) interests in Loans or Uncertificated Securities may be acquired by the Company from time to time which are not evidenced by, or accompanied by delivery of, a Security or an instrument, as that term is defined in Section 9-102(a)(4a) of the UCC, and may be evidenced solely by delivery to the Custodian of (x) a facsimile or electronic copy of an assignment agreement (“Loan Assignment Agreement”) in favor of the Company as assignee or, in respect of any Loan acquired by participation interest, a participation agreement (a “Participation Agreement”) in favor of the Company as participant or (y) a copy of the register of the underlying issuer of such interest evidencing registration of such equity interest on the books and records of the applicable issuer to the name of the Company (or its nominee) and (ii) any such Loan Assignment Agreement or Participation Agreement (and the registration of the related Loan on the books and records of the applicable obligor or bank agent) shall be registered in the name of the Company (or its nominee), and (b) nothing herein shall require the Custodian to credit to the Securities Account or to treat as a financial asset (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC) any such Loan or other asset in the nature of a general intangible (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(42) of the UCC) or to “maintain” a sufficient quantity thereof. The
    8

Custodian is not under a duty to examine any such Financing Documents, or any underlying credit agreements or loan documents for such Loan to determine the validity, sufficiency, marketability or enforceability of any Loan Assignment Agreement, Participation Agreement or other Financing Document (and shall have no responsibility for the genuineness or completeness thereof), or for the Company’s title to any related Loan.
(iii)    The Custodian may assume the genuineness of any such Financing Document it may receive and the genuineness and due authority of any signatures appearing thereon, and shall be entitled to assume that each such Financing Document it may receive is what it purports to be. If an original “security” or “instrument” as defined in Section 8-102 and Section 9-102(a)(47) of the UCC, respectively, is or shall be or becomes available with respect to any Loan to be held by the Custodian under this Agreement, it shall be the sole responsibility of the Company to make or cause delivery thereof to the Document Custodian under the Document Custody Agreement and the Custodian, and the Custodian shall not be under any obligation at any time to determine whether any such original security or instrument has been or is required to be issued or made available in respect of any Loan or to compel or cause delivery thereof to the Custodian.
(iv)    Contemporaneously with the acquisition of any Loan, the Company shall (a) cause any appropriate Financing Documents evidencing such Loan to be delivered to the Custodian; (b) if requested by the Custodian, provide to the Custodian an amortization schedule of principal payments and a schedule of the interest payable date(s) identifying the amount and due dates of all scheduled principal and interest payments for such Loan and (c) provide to the Custodian a properly completed Trade Confirmation containing such information in respect of such Loan as the Custodian may reasonably require in order to enable the Custodian to perform its duties hereunder in respect of such Loan on which the Custodian may conclusively rely without further inquiry or investigation, in such form and format as the Custodian reasonably may require; (d) take all actions necessary for the Company to acquire good title to such Loan; and (e) take all actions as may be necessary (including appropriate payment notices and instructions to bank agents or other applicable paying agents or administrative agents) to cause (A) all payments in respect of the Loan to be made to the Custodian and (B) all notices, solicitations and other communications in respect of such Loan to be directed to the Company. The Custodian shall have no liability for any delay or failure on the part of the Company to provide necessary information to the Custodian, or for any inaccuracy therein or incompleteness thereof, or for any delay or failure on the part of the Company to give such effective payment instruction to bank agents and other paying agents or administrative agents, in respect of the Loans. With respect to each such Loan, the Custodian shall be entitled to rely on any information and notices it may receive from time to time from the related bank agent, obligor, participating bank, nationally recognized pricing service or vendor, reputable financial information reporting source or similar party with respect to the related Loan, and shall be entitled to update its records (as it may deem necessary or appropriate), or from the Company, on the basis of such information or notices received, without any obligation on its part independently to verify, investigate or recalculate such information.

6.6Foreign Sub-custodian. Each contract or agreement pursuant to which the Custodian employs a Foreign Sub-custodian shall include provisions that provide: (i) for indemnification or insurance arrangements (or any combination of the foregoing) such that the Company will be adequately protected against the risk of loss of assets held in accordance with such contract; (ii) that the Company’s assets will not be subject to any right, charge, security interest, lien or claim of any kind in favor of the Sub-custodian or its creditors (except a claim of payment for their safe custody or administration) or, in the case of cash deposits, liens or rights in favor of creditors of the Sub-custodian arising under bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws; (iii) that beneficial ownership for the Company’s assets will be freely transferable without the payment of money or value other than for safe custody or administration; (iv) that adequate records will be maintained identifying the assets as belonging to the Company or as being held by a third party for the benefit of the Company; (v) that the Company’s independent public accountants will be given access to those records or confirmation of the contents of those records; and (vi) that the Company will receive periodic reports with respect to the safekeeping of the Company’s assets, including notification of any transfer to or from a Company’s account or a third party account containing assets held for the benefit of the Company.

6.7Custodian’s Responsibility for Foreign Sub-custodian.
(a)With respect to its responsibilities under this Section 6, the Custodian agrees to exercise reasonable care, prudence and diligence such as a person having responsibility for the safekeeping of property of the Company would exercise. The Custodian further agrees that the Foreign Securities will be subject to reasonable care, based on the standards applicable to the Custodian in the relevant market, if maintained with each Foreign Sub-custodian, after considering all factors relevant to the safekeeping of such assets, including: (i) the Foreign Sub-custodian’s practices, procedures, and internal controls, including the physical protections available for certificated securities (if applicable), the method of keeping custodial records, and the security and data protection practices;
    17

(ii) whether the Foreign Sub-custodian has the requisite financial strength to provide reasonable care for Company assets; (iii) the Foreign Sub-custodian’s general reputation and standing and, in the case of Eligible Securities Depository, the Eligible Securities Depository’s operating history and number of participants; and (iv) whether the Company will have jurisdiction over and be able to enforce judgments against the Foreign Sub-custodian, such as by virtue of the existence of any offices of the Foreign Sub-custodian in the United States or the Sub-custodian’s consent to service of process in the United States.
(b)At the end of each calendar quarter, or at such other times as the Company’s board of directors deems reasonable and appropriate based on the circumstances of the Company’s foreign custody arrangements, the Custodian shall provide written reports notifying the board of directors of the Company as to the placement of the Foreign Securities and cash of the Company with a particular Foreign Sub-custodian and of any material changes in the Company's foreign custody arrangements.

(c)The Custodian shall establish a system to monitor the appropriateness of maintaining the Company’s assets with a particular Foreign Sub-custodian and the performance of the contract governing the Company’s arrangements with such Foreign Sub-custodian. To the extent the Custodian holds Foreign Securities and related Proceeds with one or more Eligible Securities Depositories, the Custodian shall provide the Company with an analysis of the custody risks associated with maintaining assets with such Eligible Securities Depository and shall monitor such custody risks on a continuing basis and promptly notify the Company of any material change in these risks. The Custodian agrees to exercise reasonable care, prudence and diligence in performing its obligations under this clause (c). If the Custodian determines that a custody arrangement with an Eligible Securities Depository no longer meets the requirements of this Section, the Company’s Foreign Securities must be withdrawn from such depository as soon as reasonably practicable.

(d)The Custodian’s responsibility with respect to the selection or appointment of a Foreign Sub-custodian shall be limited to a duty to exercise reasonable care in the selection or retention of such Foreign Sub-custodian in light of prevailing settlement and securities handling practices, procedures and controls in the relevant market. With respect to any costs, expenses, damages, liabilities, or claims (including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees) incurred as a result of the acts or the failure to act by any Foreign Sub-custodian, the Custodian shall take reasonable action to recover such costs, expenses, damages, liabilities, or claims from such Foreign Sub-custodian; provided that the Custodian’s sole liability in that regard shall be limited to amounts actually received by it from such Foreign Sub-custodian (exclusive of related costs and expenses incurred by the Custodian).
