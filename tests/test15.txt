CUSTODY OF BONDS; DETAILS OF CUSTODIAL RECEIPTS
Section 2.01 Custody of Bonds; Execution and Delivery of Custodial Receipts.
 
(a) Concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof, the Depositor shall deposit with (or cause to be deposited with), if not already deposited with, and deliver to (or cause to be delivered to), if not already delivered to, the Custodian the Bonds in definitive form. Concurrently with such delivery, the Custodian, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, shall execute and deliver (i) the Senior Custodial Receipts to Freddie Mac or upon its written order and (ii) to the Depositor, the Subordinate Custodial Receipts, each in Authorized Denominations in the various series and having the terms designated on Exhibit C hereto, evidencing the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Bonds so delivered to the Custodian and the right to receive principal, including redemption price, and premium, if any, and interest payments thereon pursuant to Section 5.03 hereof and as otherwise provided herein.
 
With the prior written consent of Freddie Mac, the Depositor may deliver one or more additional series of Bonds to the Custodian on any Business Day, upon delivery to the Custodian at least five Business Days prior to such Business Day of a written notice substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit D hereto (a “Notice of Deposit”) setting forth the series designation for the Custodial Receipts to be executed and delivered on such Business Day and the Authorized Denomination, Bond Interest Payment Dates, Bond Rate, Bonds and Issuer with respect thereto.
 
 
4
 
(b) The Custodian shall accept each series of the Bonds as Custodian for the Holders of the related series of Custodial Receipts which shall be delivered hereunder to evidence ownership interests in such Bonds and the right to receive amounts thereon and shall hold the Bonds as provided hereunder.  Each Custodial Receipt shall evidence the ownership by the Holder thereof, to the extent indicated thereby, of the Bonds delivered to the Custodian with respect to such series.  If the Bonds as delivered by the Depositor are not DTC eligible securities, upon the request of the Holder of the Senior Custodial Receipts, the Custodian shall cooperate with the Issuer in taking all necessary steps to convert the definitive Bonds into DTC eligible securities.  Thereafter, the Bonds shall be credited to an account of the Custodian with DTC.
 
(c) The Custodian shall hold the Bonds delivered to it pursuant to this Agreement in custody only, identified separate and apart from the general assets of the Custodian.  The Custodian shall not have the authority to assign, transfer, pledge, setoff or otherwise dispose of the Bonds, or of any interests therein, except as provided hereunder or as required by law.  The Custodian, by its execution and delivery hereof, acknowledges receipt in physical form of each series of Bonds listed in Exhibit C hereto, together with executed appropriate instruments of transfer from the Depositor to the Custodian with respect thereto.
 
A reasonable time prior to the delivery of Bonds to the Custodian, the Depositor shall furnish the Custodian with written instructions as to the name, address and taxpayer identification number in which the Custodial Receipts shall initially be registered, the denominations in which such Custodial Receipts shall initially be recorded, the persons and addresses of such persons in whose name such Custodial Receipts are to be delivered and such other information as may be requested by the Custodian in connection with the issuance of such Custodial Receipts.  Each Custodial Receipt shall evidence the ownership by the Holder thereof, to the extent indicated thereby, of the Bonds delivered in definitive form to the Custodian.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the rights and interests of the Holder of a series of Subordinate Custodial Receipts hereunder shall be subordinate in right of payment and in all other respects to the rights of the Holder of the same series of Senior Custodial Receipts.  The Holder of a series of Senior Custodial Receipts shall exclusively hold and have all of the rights of the holder of the related Bonds with respect to any directions, notices, consents, exercise of remedies or other actions with respect to such Bonds.  No remedy shall be available to Holders of Subordinate Custodial Receipts if the Subordinate Custodial Receipts are not timely paid; provided, however, any amounts not timely paid on the Subordinate Custodial Receipts (including accruals of interest) shall remain due until paid.  The Depositor acknowledges and agrees (and each holder of Subordinate Custodial Receipts, by their acceptance thereof, shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed) to such subordination.
 
Section 2.02 Form of Custodial Receipts.
 
(a) Each Senior Custodial Receipt shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto and each Subordinate Custodial Receipt shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto, in each case with such appropriate variations, omissions and insertions as may be necessary or appropriate to conform to the provisions of this Agreement.  All Custodial Receipts may have endorsed thereon such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or text as may be necessary or appropriate to conform to any applicable rules and regulations of any governmental authority or of any securities exchange on which the Custodial Receipts may be listed or any usage or requirement of law with respect thereto.  The Depositor shall furnish the Custodian with all information necessary for the completion of any legend on the Custodial Receipts required by the federal income taxation or securities laws or regulations and for the completion of any forms determined by the Depositor to be required to be furnished to Holders or the Internal Revenue Service by such laws or regulations to the extent such information is obtainable at the time of original issuance of Custodial Receipts.

(b) Custodial Receipts shall be authenticated by the Custodian by the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Custodian.  No Custodial Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless it shall have been authenticated by the Custodian by the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory.  The Custodian shall record in the Custodial Receipt Register each Custodial Receipt so signed and delivered as herein provided.
 
Section 2.03 Registration and Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Custodial Receipts.
 
(a) The Custodian shall keep at its designated office in Birmingham, Alabama, a register (the “Custodial Receipt Register”) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Custodian shall provide for the registration and the registration of transfers or exchanges of Custodial Receipts.  Transfers of ownership of the Custodial Receipts shall be recorded by the Custodian in the Custodial Receipt Register.
 
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08 upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Custodial Receipt at the Custodian’s Designated Office, the Custodian shall execute and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Custodial Receipts of any Authorized Denominations of the same series and seniority and of like aggregate principal amount, and evidencing, in the aggregate, the same beneficial ownership interest in the Bonds; provided, however, that the Subordinate Custodial Receipts may be transferred in whole but not in part and only with the prior written consent of Freddie Mac.
 
(c) At the option of the Holder, Senior Custodial Receipts may be exchanged for other Senior Custodial Receipts of any Authorized Denominations of same series and seniority and of like aggregate principal amount, and evidencing, in the aggregate, the same beneficial ownership interest in the Bonds, upon surrender of the Custodial Receipts to be exchanged to the Custodian’s Designated Office.  Subordinate Custodial Receipts may only be outstanding in a single certificate.
 
(d) Each Custodial Receipt and all ownership interests therein issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of any Custodial Receipt shall evidence ownership, in accordance with the terms of such Custodial Receipt, of the related series of Bonds, the right to receive principal, including redemption price of, and premium, if any, and interest payments on such Bonds, but subject to the subordination of the related Subordinate Custodial Receipts to the related Senior Custodial Receipts as herein provided.  Each Custodial Receipt of the same series and seniority shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement as the ownership interests in such Custodial Receipts surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
 
6
 
(e) Every Custodial Receipt  presented for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Custodian) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Custodian and duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
Section 2.04 Limitations on Execution and Delivery, Surrender, Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Custodial Receipts.  As a condition precedent to the execution and delivery, surrender or registration of transfer or exchange of any Custodial Receipt, the Custodian may require payment, by the Holder requesting such action, of the then applicable service charge of the Custodian and of a sum sufficient for reimbursement of any tax or other governmental charge with respect thereto, may require the production of proof reasonably satisfactory to it as to the identity and genuineness of any signature and may also require compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Custodian may reasonably establish consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.
 
Section 2.05 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Custodial Receipts.  In case any Custodial Receipt shall be mutilated, the Custodian in its discretion may execute and deliver a Custodial Receipt of like form, tenor and seniority, and in the same denomination and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for such mutilated Custodial Receipt.  In case any Custodial Receipt shall be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Custodian may execute and deliver a Custodial Receipt of like form, tenor and seniority, and in the same denomination and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in lieu of and in substitution for such destroyed, lost or stolen Custodial Receipt, only upon (i) the filing by the Holder thereof with the Custodian of evidence satisfactory to the Custodian of the destruction, loss or theft of such Custodial Receipt and of the authenticity of such Holder’s ownership thereof, and (ii) the furnishing to the Custodian of reasonable security and/or indemnification satisfactory to it.  All expenses and charges associated with such security and/or indemnity and with the preparation, execution and delivery of a new Custodial Receipt shall be borne by the Holder of the Custodial Receipt mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen.
 
Section 2.06 Ownership of Custodial Receipts.  The Custodian and the Depositor and any of their respective agents may treat the person in whose name any Custodial Receipt is registered on the Custodial Receipt Register, including, without limitation, DTC or its nominee, as the owner of such Custodial Receipt for the purpose of receiving distributions of principal and interest on or purchase price in respect of, such Custodial Receipt, and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Custodial Receipt is overdue, and, to the extent permitted by law, neither the Custodian, the Depositor nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
Section 2.07 Subsequent Establishment of Book-Entry Only System for Senior Custodial Receipts.
 
(a) Initially, the Custodial Receipts shall be delivered in the form of physical certificates, provided Freddie Mac as Holder of the  Senior Custodial Receipts may direct that the Custodian establish a book-entry only system of registration for the Senior Custodial Receipts through the facilities of DTC, in which case, the Senior Custodial Receipts will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as the nominee of DTC.  (The Depositor shall be responsible for any costs in connection with the establishment of such book-entry only system for the Senior Custodial Receipts.)  Transfers of beneficial ownership interests in the Senior Custodial Receipts which are registered in the name of Cede & Co. will be accomplished by book entries made by DTC and in turn by the DTC Participants who act on behalf of the Beneficial Owners of Senior Custodial Receipts.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each series of Subordinate Custodial Receipts may only be issued in physical certificated form and shall not be in the book-entry only system.
 
 
7
 
(b) At any time the Senior Custodial Receipts are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee to establish a book-entry system of registration, neither the Custodian, Freddie Mac, the Depositor, nor any of their respective affiliates shall have any responsibility or obligation with respect to:
 
(i) the accuracy of the records of DTC or any DTC Participant with respect to any beneficial ownership interest in the Senior Custodial Receipts;
 
(ii) the delivery to any DTC Participant, any Beneficial Owner or any other person, other than DTC, of any notice with respect to the Senior Custodial Receipts;
 
(iii) the payment to any DTC Participant, any Beneficial Owner or any other person, other than DTC, of any amount distributable with respect to the Senior Custodial Receipts; or
 
(iv) the failure of DTC to effect any transfer.
 
(c) So long as the Senior Custodial Receipts are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, the Custodian may treat DTC as, and deem DTC to be, the absolute owner of the Senior Custodial Receipts for all purposes whatsoever, including without limitation:
 
(i) the payment of distributions to Holders of the Senior Custodial Receipts;
 
(ii) giving notices of redemption, tender and other matters with respect to the Senior Custodial Receipts;
 
(iii) registering transfers with respect to the Senior Custodial Receipts; and
 
(iv) the selection of Senior Custodial Receipts for redemption or tender.
 
(d) If at any time following the establishment of a book-entry system for the Senior Custodial Receipts, DTC notifies the Custodian that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Securities Depository with respect to the Senior Custodial Receipts, or if at any time DTC shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation and a successor Securities Depository is not appointed by Freddie Mac as Holder of the Senior Custodial Receipts within ninety (90) days after it receives notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, or if the Freddie Mac as Holder of the Senior Custodial Receipts determines that it is in its best interest to obtain the Senior Custodial Receipts in certificated form, then the Custodian shall execute and deliver physical certificates representing the Senior Custodial Receipts in exchange for the global certificates which shall be registered in the name of Freddie Mac or upon its order.
 
 
8
 
Section 2.08 Limitations on Transfer.
 
(a) Neither the Custodial Receipts nor any interest therein may be transferred or resold (i) except as permitted under the Securities Act pursuant to registration or an exemption therefrom or (ii) to a transferee that is an employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is subject to Title I of ERISA, a plan as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, or an entity whose underlying assets include the assets of any such plan by reason of a plan’s investment in the entity, or otherwise or (iii) to a transferee that is not a “qualified purchaser” as defined in Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act.  The Subordinate Custodial Receipts can only be held by a single Holder and can only be transferred with the consent of Freddie Mac.
 
(b) For the purpose of monitoring compliance with the foregoing restrictions, each transferee of a Custodial Receipt or a beneficial interest therein (other than Freddie Mac) shall deliver a completed and duly executed purchaser’s letter to the Custodian in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E-1, or in the case of a trust which the Depositor has formed, Exhibit E-2 (each, a “Purchaser’s Letter”).  Any Purchaser’s Letter shall be available for inspection by the Depositor during normal business hours.  The Depositor and the Custodian may rely conclusively upon the information contained in any such Purchaser’s Letter in the absence of actual knowledge to the contrary.  In connection with any transfer, Custodian shall be provided with an unqualified Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such transfer may be effected without registration under the Securities Act or the registration requirements of any person under the Investment Company Act.
 
(c) All Custodial Receipts shall bear legends stating that they have not been registered under the Securities Act and are subject to the transfer requirements described in Section 2.08(a) and (b) hereof.  By purchasing a Custodial Receipt or any interest therein, each purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed to these transfer requirements.
 
(d) The Custodial Receipts and related documentation including this Agreement may be amended or supplemented from time to time by the Depositor (with the prior written consent of Freddie Mac) to modify the restrictions on and procedures for resale and other transfers of the Custodial Receipts and interests therein to reflect any change in applicable law or regulation (or the interpretation thereof) or in practices relating to the resale or other transfer of restricted securities generally if the Depositor, the Custodian and Freddie Mac shall have received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such amendment or supplement is necessary or appropriate.
 
(e) In order to preserve the exemption for resales and transfers provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act, the Depositor shall provide to any Holder of a Custodial Receipt and any prospective purchaser designated by such Holder, upon request of such Holder or such prospective purchaser, such information which is reasonably available to the Depositor and required by Rule 144A as will enable the resale of such Custodial Receipt to be made pursuant to Rule 144A.  In addition (with the prior written consent of Freddie Mac, the Depositor may from time to time modify the foregoing restrictions on resale and other transfers (including the form of Purchaser’s Letter), without the consent but upon notice to the Holders of the Custodial Receipts, in order to reflect any amendment to Rule 144A or change in the interpretation thereof or practices there under if the Depositor, Custodian and Freddie Mac shall have received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such amendment or supplement is necessary or appropriate.

Section 2.09 Surrender of Custodial Receipts and Withdrawal of Bonds.  At any time a Holder may withdraw a series of Bonds from the custody of this Agreement by surrendering all of the related Senior Custodial Receipts and Subordinate Custodial Receipts, with the assignment fully completed, at the Designated Office (including where the Depositor is the Holder of a Senior Custodial Receipt due to a Release Event funded by the Sponsor pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement).  At the time of such surrender, the Custodian shall, without unreasonable delay, either deliver such Bonds, with all necessary endorsements, to such Holder or upon request of the Holder, the Custodian will register such Bonds in the name of such person; provided that the Custodian may require payment of a sum sufficient for reimbursement of any tax or other governmental charge with respect thereto.  Upon delivery of such Bonds by the Custodian to such Holder, the Bonds shall cease to be entitled to the benefit of this Agreement and the Custodian shall have no further obligation to the Holder with respect thereto.
 
Section 2.10 Withdrawal of Bonds Due to Certain Events
 
(a) In addition to any other rights granted to Holders of Senior Custodial Receipts pursuant to this Agreement, in the event (i) a Senior Custodial Receipt ever receives less than a full payment on any related bond payment date, (ii) a separate Release Event not including a payment default has occurred with respect to a series of underlying Bonds and Freddie Mac as Holder of the related series of Senior Custodial Receipts has exercised its right to cause a Release Event of such Senior Custodial Receipt which Release Event is funded by Freddie Mac pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement, or (iii) an “Event of Default” has occurred and is continuing under the Reimbursement Agreement, then the Custodian shall, upon written direction from Freddie Mac as holder of the applicable Senior Custodial Receipts, release and deliver all the related Bonds from the custody of this Agreement to Freddie Mac and shall assign (pursuant to such documentation requested by Freddie Mac) all of its rights, title and interests in such Bonds to Freddie Mac.  Upon receipt of such Bonds pursuant to the foregoing, Freddie Mac shall have the right (in its sole discretion) to exercise any and all rights and remedies as the sole holder of such Bonds under the related Bond Documents and Bond Mortgage Documents, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose on the related mortgage.  Any proceeds resulting from Freddie Mac’s exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to a series of Bonds pursuant to this Section 2.10(a) shall be used first to reimburse Freddie Mac in full for any unpaid amounts then owed Freddie Mac in connection with any such Bonds (including any costs or expenses of collection or enforcement associated with the taking of any such remedial actions) or otherwise owed in connection with any such Release Event or Event of Default under the Reimbursement Agreement.  Any amounts remaining after Freddie Mac’s reimbursement in accordance with the foregoing sentence shall be distributed by Freddie Mac to the Depositor.
 
(b) The Depositor acknowledges and agrees (and each holder (including holders of a beneficial interest) of Subordinate Custodial Receipts, by their acceptance thereof, shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed) that Freddie Mac shall have the right to direct the removal of Bonds from the custody of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 2.10.  The Depositor hereby appoints (and each holder shall be deemed to have appointed) Freddie Mac as its attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of the Depositor and in the name of the Depositor, from time to time in Freddie Mac’s discretion, to take any action and to execute any instrument which Freddie Mac may reasonably deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.10.  The power of attorney established pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.

The RB-7-2 Subordinate Receipt shall be issued in an original principal amount equal to the outstanding principal balance of the delivered RA-7-2 Senior Custodial Receipt and shall represent a subordinate ownership interest in the underlying Villages at Lost Creek Bonds subject in all respects to the terms of this Agreement, including those governing Subordinate Custodial Receipts.

ARTICLE V 
PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST; REDEMPTION
Section 5.01 Application of Moneys on Payment Dates.
 
(a) On each Custodial Receipts Payment Date, the Custodian shall pay amounts received by the Custodian as principal or redemption price (as defined with respect to such Bonds) of and interest on the Bonds, from the Issuer thereof or any other entity obligated to make payments to such Issuer (or its trustee or other applicable fiduciary) with respect to the Bonds, to the Holders of the Custodial Receipts of the applicable series evidencing ownership of such Bonds.  The foregoing notwithstanding, if amounts received by and on deposit with the Custodian with respect to any series of Bonds are insufficient on any Custodial Receipts Payment Date to make all payments then due and owing on the related series of the Senior Custodial Receipts, then the Custodian shall make no payment to the Holders of the related series of Subordinate Custodial Receipts from such amounts on deposit with the Custodian unless and until all amounts due to the Holders of such Senior Custodial Receipts on such Custodial Receipts Payment Date have been paid in full.
 
The Subordinate Custodial Receipts shall be and are hereby subordinated in priority and in right and time of payment to all amounts currently due and payable to the Holders of the Senior Custodial Receipts of the applicable series evidencing ownership of the same Bonds.  Payment of a series of Subordinate Custodial Receipts shall be made by the Custodian only from excess moneys or assets not required to pay the same series of Senior Custodial Receipts, and no payment shall be due or payable on such Subordinate Custodial Receipts (and the Holders of the Subordinate Custodial Receipts, by acceptance of the Subordinate Custodial Receipts, expressly agree and acknowledge that no payment shall be due and payable on the Subordinate Custodial Receipts as described herein) (i) if the Custodian does not hold sufficient funds to make such payment or (ii) if any monies then due and payable in respect of the same series of Senior Custodial Receipts are unpaid, until such monies are paid in full.
 
 
14
 
The Holder of a series of Senior Custodial Receipts shall exclusively hold and have all of the rights of the holder of the related Bonds with respect to any directions, notices, consents, exercise of remedies or other actions with respect to such Bonds.  No remedy shall be available to Holders of Subordinate Custodial Receipts if a default in payment of the Subordinate Custodial Receipts then exists; provided, however, any amounts not timely paid on the Subordinate Custodial Receipts shall remain due until paid.
 
(b) Each payment by the Custodian to a Holder as of the applicable Record Date of principal of and interest on Custodial Receipts shall be sent by the Custodian on each Custodial Receipts Payment Date by check Mailed to its address appearing on the Custodial Receipt Registrar on the applicable Record Date (or via electronic transfer in accordance with wiring instructions provided by such Holder), except that in the case of Freddie Mac or the Depositor, payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such entities pursuant to wire instructions provided thereby or as directed by Freddie Mac and the Depositor.  Any such request shall remain in effect until revoked or revised by such Holder by an instrument in writing delivered to the Custodian. Custodial Receipts shall be surrendered at the Designated Office of the Custodian upon termination of this Agreement following the final Custodial Receipts Payment Date.  Surrender of Custodial Receipts shall not be a condition of payment thereof.
 
(c) Each Custodial Receipt surrendered to the Custodian for the payment thereof shall be promptly cancelled and destroyed by the Custodian and shall no longer be outstanding for any purchase under this Agreement.
 
Section 5.02 Segregation of Moneys.  All moneys received from the Issuer or otherwise by the Custodian in respect of a series of Bonds shall be held by it (i) in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the related series of Custodial Receipts and (ii) uninvested without interest in separate accounts designated to match the related series of Custodial Receipts until required to be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or as otherwise required by law and such moneys will be segregated from the general assets of the Custodian and from any other money held by the Custodian by separate recordation on the books and records of the Custodian.  In no event shall moneys received by the Custodian on account of a series of Bonds be applied or available for any purpose for any series of Custodial Receipts other than the series of Custodial Receipts related to such series of Bonds.
 
Section 5.03 Redemption.
 
(a) If all the outstanding Bonds underlying any series of Custodial Receipts are redeemed in full in accordance with the terms of the Bonds, the Custodian, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.03, shall redeem in full the related series of Custodial Receipts.  Upon such redemption of any Custodial Receipt, the Holder will have no right (other than claw back rights under the United States Bankruptcy Code) to receive payments after the Redemption Date, except to receive amounts payable under Section 5.01 hereof (the “Redemption Price”).  Any mandatory tender of or purchase in lieu of redemption of the Bonds pursuant to the constituent bond (and, as applicable, trust) documents shall be treated by the Custodian in the same manner as a redemption of the Bonds in full.  Upon any mandatory tender of or purchase in lieu of redemption of the Bonds the Custodian shall deliver such Bonds to the trustee therefor upon payment therefor.
 
 
15
 
(b) In the event of a partial redemption of the Bonds underlying any series of Custodial Receipts, the related series of Senior Custodial Receipts and Subordinate Custodial Receipts shall be redeemed on a pro rata basis, except in the event of any shortfall in payment of the scheduled principal due with respect to such series of Bonds in connection with any such partial redemption, the related Senior Custodial Receipts shall be redeemed prior to any use of such redemption payment to pay principal of the related Subordinate Custodial Receipts.  In the case of a partial redemption, to the extent practical, the Custodian shall redeem Custodial Receipts so that not more than one is other than an Authorized Denomination.
 
(c) Notice of redemption of Custodial Receipts shall be given by the Custodian by mail to each Holder of any Custodial Receipt to be redeemed within five (5) days after notice of redemption of the underlying Bonds has been received by the Custodian.  All notices of redemption shall state the date fixed for redemption of the Custodial Receipts, the place at which Custodial Receipts are to be surrendered for payment, whether the payment upon redemption includes any redemption premium and the amount thereof, that interest on amounts of Custodial Receipts redeemed will cease to accrue from and after the Redemption Date and, if less than the full principal amount of a Holder’s Custodial Receipt is to be redeemed, the principal amounts of the Custodial Receipt to be redeemed, and that upon surrender of such Custodial Receipt for payment the Custodian shall deliver to, or upon written order of, such Holder a new Custodial Receipt, evidencing the amount not redeemed in Authorized Denominations (subject to Section 5.01(b) hereof with respect to payments by wire transfer).

16
 
(b) Neither the Custodian nor the Depositor is authorized to proceed against the Issuer in the event of a default or to assert the rights and privileges of Holders of Custodial Receipts and neither has any duty to do so, except that the Custodian upon being furnished indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, subject to the terms of this Agreement, at the request of any Holder of a Custodial Receipt (but at the expense and risk of the Holder), shall take such action as it is directed to take by such Holder, in its capacity as Custodian and as the registered owner or nominal holder and custodian of the Bond to which the Custodial Receipt relates, including to proceed directly and individually against the Issuer of the Bonds or any other entity obligated to make payments to the Issuer thereof (or its trustee or other applicable fiduciary) with respect to the Bonds.  The foregoing shall not impair any rights a Holder (including Freddie Mac), or the Depositor may have to take such actions directly if any such parties subsequently become the holder of Bonds.

Section 6.03 Prevention or Delay in Performance by the Custodian or the Depositor.  Neither the Custodian nor the Depositor shall incur any liability to any Holder of any Custodial Receipt, if by reason of any provision of any present or future law, or regulation thereunder, any decree, order or act or refusal to act of any governmental authority, or by any reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Custodian or the Depositor shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or thing which the terms of this Agreement provide shall be done or performed; and neither the Custodian nor the Depositor shall incur any liability to any Holder of a Custodial Receipt by reason of any non-performance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing which the terms of this Agreement provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Agreement.
 
Section 6.04 Obligations of the Custodian.
 
(a) The Custodian assumes no obligation nor shall be subject to any liability under this Agreement to Holders of Custodial Receipts, other than by reason of willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in  this Agreement.  No provision of this Agreement shall require the Custodian to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
 
17
 
(b) The Custodian shall not be liable to any Holder of any Custodial Receipt for any action or non-action by it in reliance upon the advice of or information from legal counsel or accountants.

Section 6.05 Resignation and Removal of the Custodian; Appointment of Successor Custodian.
 
(a) The Custodian may at any time resign as Custodian hereunder by written notice of its election to do so, delivered to the Depositor and Freddie Mac, and such resignation shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor Custodian and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided; provided, however, that, in the event of such resignation, the Custodian shall reimburse the Depositor for any fees or charges previously paid to the Custodian in respect of duties not yet performed under this Agreement which remain to be performed by a successor Custodian.
 
(b) The Depositor may, with the prior written consent of Freddie Mac, at any time remove the Custodian with or without cause as Custodian hereunder by written notice of its election to do so, delivered to the Custodian as provided in Section 9.01 hereof, and such removal shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor Custodian by the Depositor and its acceptance of such appointment as provided in the succeeding paragraphs.  No successor Custodian shall be appointed hereunder without the prior written consent of Freddie Mac, and if an “Event of Default” is existing under the Reimbursement Agreement, Freddie Mac shall have the sole right to remove and appoint a Custodian under this Agreement.
 
 
18
 
(c) In case at any time the Custodian acting hereunder notifies the Depositor and Freddie Mac that it elects to resign or is incapable of acting hereunder or the Depositor notifies the Custodian and Freddie Mac that it elects to remove the Custodian as Custodian, the Depositor with the consent of Freddie Mac shall, within ninety (90) days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, appoint a successor Custodian, which shall be a bank with trust powers or trust company having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 or whose obligations hereunder are guaranteed by a person whose capital and surplus or net worth is at least that amount.  If no successor Custodian has been appointed as successor Custodian within ninety (90) days after the Custodian has give written notice of its election to resign or the Depositor has given written notice to the Custodian of its election to remove the Custodian, as the case may be, the Custodian may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Custodian.  Every successor Custodian shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Depositor an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder and shall notify the Depositor and Freddie Mac of its Designated Office, and thereupon such successor Custodian, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Custodian under this Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Depositor, shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights, obligations and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all right, title and interest in the Bonds and parts thereof to such successor Custodian.  Any successor Custodian shall promptly give notice of its appointment to the Holders of Custodial Receipts for which it is successor Custodian as provided in Section 9.01 hereof.

Section 9.10 Tax Election.  Each Holder of Custodial Receipts acknowledges and agrees that, for federal, state and local income tax purposes, each related series of Senior Custodial Receipts and the corresponding series of Subordinate Custodial Receipts, and the custodial arrangement applicable thereto as provided herein, will be treated as a separate partnership in which such Holder is a partner.  Each Holder of Custodial Receipts authorizes the Sponsor, the Custodian and Freddie Mac to take the necessary steps to make a “monthly closing election” on behalf of each such partnership in accordance with IRS Revenue Procedure 2003-84, in which case each Holder of Custodial Receipts will be deemed to have consented to such election.  No Person is authorized to elect to have any series of Senior Custodial Receipts and the corresponding series of Subordinate Custodial Receipts, and the custodial arrangement applicable thereto as provided herein, classified as a corporation (or association) for federal or any applicable state or local income tax purposes.
 
Section 9.11 Successor Depositor.  Subject to the prior consent of the Custodian and Freddie Mac, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, the Depositor may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a successor depositor.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time following Freddie Mac’s transfer of ownership of any series of Senior Custodial Receipts, all of its rights and benefits as Holder thereof as indicated herein with respect to the series of related Bonds (including but not limited to all rights to give directions, give or receive notices or consents, direct or vote or otherwise control the exercise the remedies upon a bond default or take any other action with respect to such series of Bonds) shall terminate (other than its rights to receive any payment due with respect to such series of Senior Custodial Receipts prior to such transfer), and thereafter all such rights and benefits shall vest in the transferee of such series of Senior Custodial Receipts, as the new Holder thereof (or in the case of multiple transferees, in the Holder of the majority principal amount of such series of Senior Custodial Receipts).
 
 
25
 
Section 9.13 Force Majeure.  In no event shall the Custodian be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services; it being understood that the Custodian shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.

Re:
$[______], [Senior/Subordinate] Custodial Receipts, Series R[A][B]-[_____]

Ladies and Gentlemen:

1. This letter applies to the above-referenced series of Custodial Receipts (the “Receipts”), which are issued pursuant to a Custody Agreement, dated as of September 1, 2010 (as amended, restated and/or supplemented from time to time, the “Custody Agreement”), between ATAX TEBS I, LLC, as Depositor (the “Depositor”) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Custodian (the “Custodian”).  Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Custody Agreement.
 
2. The Undersigned (hereinafter “we” or the “Undersigned”) agrees that this letter shall apply to all transfers by us of Receipts and beneficial interests in Receipts including sales of and offers to sell Receipts and beneficial interest in Receipts and any voluntary or involuntary transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of Receipts (hereinafter collectively “Transfers” or to “Transfer”).  We agree that:
 
(a)           Transfers of Receipts and beneficial interests in Receipts by us shall be made only in the Authorized Denominations set forth in the Custody Agreement,
 
(b)           we will only Transfer Receipts and beneficial interests therein held by us from time to time subject to and in accordance with the restrictions imposed by the Custody Agreement and any other transfer restrictions or other related procedures as described in the Custody Agreement,
 
(c)           we will make Transfers of Receipts and we will permit the Transfers of beneficial interests in Receipts only to a purchaser or transferee that has signed and delivered to the Custodian, a letter in form and substance substantially identical to this letter,
 
E-1-1
 
 
(d)           we shall advise the Custodian of each Transfer of Receipts and beneficial interests in Receipts and the identity of each transferee,
 
(e)           we understand that a restrictive legend will be placed on the Receipts, and
 
(f)           no Transfer of the Receipts or beneficial interests in the Receipts may be made unless the Custodian shall consent to such Transfer.
 
3. We authorize and instruct our DTC Participant to disclose to the Custodian such information concerning our beneficial ownership of Receipts as the Custodian shall request.
 
4. This letter is not a commitment by us to purchase any Receipts.
 
5. Our DTC Participant with The Depository Trust Company is [give both name and number], and our taxpayer identification number is [_____________].
 
6. We represent and agree as follows:
 
(a)           We understand and expressly acknowledge that the Receipts have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), or any applicable state securities laws, and accordingly, that the Receipts and beneficial interests in the Receipts may not be Transferred, pledged or hypothecated unless an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act and any applicable state securities laws are available.
 
(b)           We understand that the arrangement evidenced by the Custody Agreement is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), but that such arrangement is exempt from registration as such by virtue of Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, which in general excludes from the definition of an investment company any issuer whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned by only “qualified purchasers” (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act) and which has not made and does not propose to make a public offering of its securities.  We are a “qualified purchaser” as such term is defined in the 1940 Act and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
 
(c)           The Undersigned: is acquiring the Receipts or a beneficial ownership interest in the Receipts as principal for its own account for investment and not for sale in connection with any distribution thereof; was not formed solely for the purpose of investing in the Receipts; is not a (i) partnership, (ii) common trust fund, or (iii) special trust, pension fund or retirement plan in which the partners, beneficiaries or participants, as the case may be, may designate the particular investments to be made or the allocation thereof; agrees that it shall not hold such Receipts or such beneficial interest in the Receipts for the benefit of any other person and shall be the sole beneficial owner thereof for all purposes; shall not sell participation interests in the Receipts or beneficial ownership interests in the Receipts or enter into any other arrangement pursuant to which any other person shall be entitled to a beneficial interest in the distributions on the Receipts.  The purchase of the amount of Receipts or beneficial interest in the Receipts indicated above (together with any other Receipts in the same series owned directly or indirectly by the purchaser) constitutes an investment of no more than 40% of the purchaser’s assets.
 
E-1-2
 
 
(d)           We are either “accredited investors” within the meaning of Section 501(a)(1)-(4), (7) or (8) of Regulation D under the 1933 Act (an “Accredited Investor”) or “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the 1933 Act (a “QIB”) with respect to the Receipts to be purchased by us, with such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Receipts, and are able and prepared to bear the economic risk of investing in and holding such Receipts.  The Undersigned will not Transfer the Receipts or permit beneficial interests in the Custodial Receipts to be transferred except to a purchaser that (i) (A) (1) is a QIB, (2) is aware that the sale of the Receipts to it is being made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the 1933 Act and (3) is acquiring the Receipts (or beneficial interests therein) for its own account or for one or more accounts, each of which is a QIB and as to each of which the purchaser exercises sole investment discretion, or (B) (1) is an Accredited Investor and (2) is acquiring the Receipts for its own account, and (ii) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Receipts and such purchaser and any accounts for which it is acting are each able to bear the economic risk of the purchaser’s or account’s the investment.
 
(e)           Neither we nor anyone acting on our behalf has offered or sold or will offer or sell any Receipt or beneficial interest therein by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising or has taken or will take any action that would constitute a distribution of a Receipt or beneficial interest therein under the 1933 Act, would render the disposition of a Receipt or a beneficial interest therein a violation of Section 5 of the 1933 Act or any state or other securities law or would require registration or qualification pursuant thereto.
 
(f)           We have received a copy of the Custody Agreement, and to the extent we have required additional documents or information concerning the Receipts or the securities underlying the Receipts, we have obtained such other documents or information.
 
(g)           We are not an employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)) that is subject to Title I of ERISA, a plan as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or an entity whose underlying assets include the assets of any such plan by reason of a plan’s investment in the entity, or otherwise.
 
(h)           We acknowledge that we will treat the custodial arrangement established with respect to each series of Receipts as a partnership for federal, state and local income tax purposes and that we intend and expect to be treated as a partner for such purposes.  We acknowledge that no Person is authorized under Treas. Reg. Section 301.7701-3(c) or any applicable state or local law to have the custodial arrangement established with respect to each series of Receipts classified as a corporation for federal, state or local income tax purposes.  We consent to an election under Revenue Procedure 2003-84 (or any successor Revenue Procedure or other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service) to account for items of Receipts tax-exempt income, taxable income (if any), gain, loss and deduction on the basis of a monthly closing of the books, and agrees to comply with the alternative reporting requirements prescribed by Revenue Procedure 2003-84, if such election is made.
 
E-1-3
 
 
(i)           The Undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing are ongoing representations and hereby agrees to notify the Custodian in writing if it becomes aware that any of the representations are no longer accurate.
 
7. This letter shall be for the benefit of the Custodian, any DTC Participant through which the Undersigned holds Receipts, DTC, the Depositor and any transferor to or transferee from the Undersigned.  We recognize that such parties will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the representations and agreements set forth in this letter and we agree that each of our purchases of Receipts now or in the future shall be deemed to constitute our concurrence in and ratification of the entire contents of this letter and shall apply equally to any such subsequent purchase.
