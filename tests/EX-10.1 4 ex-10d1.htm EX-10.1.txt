Vesting

You can earn the PSUs awarded above based on IBM’s Relative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) modifier over each three-year Performance Period that could result in (1) the percentage of PSUs earned being reduced up to 20 points if the performance falls below the S&P 500 Index median; or (2) the percentage of PSUs earned being increased up to 20 points when IBM exceeds the median performance of both the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Information Technology Index. The relative ROIC modifier has no effect on the percentage of PSUs earned when IBM’s ROIC performance falls between the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Information Technology Index median.

Payout of Awards

Following the Date of Payout, the Company shall either (a) deliver to you a number of shares of Capital Stock equal to the number of your earned PSUs, or (b) make a cash payment to you equal to the Fair Market Value on the Date of Payout of the number of your earned PSUs at the end of the Performance Period, in either case, net of any applicable tax withholding, and the respective PSUs shall thereafter be canceled.

 

All payouts under this Award are subject to the provisions of the Plan, this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions document, including those relating to the cancellation and rescission of awards.
