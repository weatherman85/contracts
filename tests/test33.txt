Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Lazard Board.

[[6065250]]

 

responsibilities as shall be specified in the designating resolution.

Each committee shall keep written minutes of its proceedings and shall report such proceedings to the Lazard Board when required.  A majority of any committee may determine its action and fix the time and place of its meetings, unless the Lazard Board shall otherwise provide.  Notice of such meetings shall be given to each member of the committee in the manner provided for in Section 3.02(d).  The Lazard Board shall have power at any time to fill vacancies in, to change the membership of, or to dissolve any such committee.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the Lazard Board from appointing one or more committees consisting in whole or in part of persons who are not Directors of the Company; provided, however, that, except as set forth in the following sentence, no such committee shall have or may exercise any authority of the Lazard Board.  Except as specifically set forth herein regarding the Managing Members, with respect to any and all matters hereunder relating to the PIPR Interests, including the determinations, allocations, valuations and other matters contemplated by Section 5.05 and all determinations pursuant to any PIPR Agreement, any provision hereunder requiring the act or approval of the Lazard Board shall be deemed satisfied (with respect to such act or approval of the Lazard Board) if the act or approval is taken or approved by the Lazard Board or by the Compensation Committee.

Each Common Member shall be deemed to have a Common Interest in the Company, which Common Interest shall entitle such holder to the rights, and subject such holder to the obligations, set forth in this Agreement.  The Lazard Board shall have the authority to cause the Company to issue Common Interests in its discretion.  The Managing Members shall have the authority to cause the Company to issue Common Interests to any Common Member and to any person who is admitted as an additional Common Member in accordance with this Agreement.  Schedule 1.01(a) sets forth the Common Percentage Interest of each of the Common Members.  Such schedule shall be amended pursuant to Section 1.03 to reflect any issuance of Common Interests in accordance with this Agreement.  For purposes of certain provisions of this Agreement, the Common Interests are deemed to be divided into units (the “Deemed Common Units”) in a number equal to the total number of outstanding shares of Lazard Ltd Common Stock, excluding shares held by Lazard Ltd or any of its Subsidiaries, as of the applicable time.

(b)Profit Participation Interests.  (i) The Profit Participation Interests shall consist of, and be allocated as, Profit Participation Percentages and Profit Participation Capital.  The aggregate of all Profit Participation Percentages shall total 100%.  The Profit Participation Percentages allocated to each of the Profit Participation Members and the Profit Participation Percentage contained in the Unallocated Float are set forth on Schedule 4.01.

(iii)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Lazard Board shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to terminate the Profit Participation Interests, effective at the time specified in the resolutions of the Lazard Board approving such termination or, if not so specified in such resolutions, at the time that the resolutions approving such termination are approved by the Lazard Board.  Upon termination of the Profit Participation Interests, all Profit Participation Interests shall immediately cease to be outstanding and shall no longer be allocable by the Company, and such termination shall have the effects set forth in Section 4.04(b)(ii).

(c)PIPR Interests.  (i) Generally.  Each PIPR Member shall be deemed to have a PIPR Interest in the Company, which PIPR Interest shall entitle such holder to the rights, and subject such holder to the obligations, set forth in this Agreement and the applicable PIPR Agreement.  The PIPR Interests shall consist of, and be issued as, units (“PIPR Units”) and PIPR Capital Accounts.  The number of PIPR Units issued to each PIPR Member, whether such PIPR Units are Service and Performance Vested PIPR Units or Unvested PIPR Units and whether any such PIPR Units are Performance PIPRs shall be set forth in Schedule 4.03(c). Schedule 4.03(c) shall be amended pursuant to Section 1.03 to reflect any change in the identity of any PIPR Member or the PIPR Units held by any PIPR Member and whether such PIPR Units are Service and Performance Vested PIPR Units, Performance PIPRs or Unvested PIPR Units in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable PIPR Agreement.

(ii)Intended Tax Treatment of PIPR Units.  The PIPR Units are intended to be treated for tax purposes as “profits interests” within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 93-27, 1993-2 C.B. 343, and Rev. Proc. 2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191.  The receipt of the PIPR Units is intended to be treated as a non-taxable event for the Company and the PIPR Member.  In consideration of the receipt of the PIPR Units, the PIPR Member shall agree not to take any position inconsistent with the foregoing.  The Company and the Members shall treat each PIPR Member as a Member of the Company as of the Grant Date for all purposes.  Each PIPR Member shall take into account the distributive share of the Company’s income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit associated with such PIPR Member’s PIPR Units in computing such PIPR Member’s income tax liability for the entire period during which such PIPR Member holds the PIPR Units.  Upon the grant of the PIPR Units or at any time on or before the date on which the PIPR Units become Service and Performance Vested PIPR Units, neither the Company nor any of the Members shall deduct any amount (as wages, compensation, or otherwise) for the fair market value of the PIPR Units.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no PIPR Member shall dispose of any portion of his or her PIPR Units within two years of receipt, unless permitted to do so by the Company.  Neither the Company nor any Member shall take any action or position, or make any filing, inconsistent with the treatment described in this Section 4.03(c)(ii).

(iii)Section 83(b) Election.  Absent a contrary determination by the Company, each person who is issued a PIPR Unit shall, as a condition precedent to the grant of such PIPR Unit, file a valid and timely election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to such PIPR Unit and provide a copy of the election to the Company.

(iv)Forfeiture; Reallocation of PIPR Capital.  If the Compensation Committee determines that it is in the best interests of the Company or any of its Affiliates due to accounting, regulatory, tax, strategic planning or other reasons, any Non-Equitized PIPR Units of any Member shall be subject to forfeiture, cancelation or termination in accordance with the applicable PIPR Agreement.  In the event of the forfeiture, cancelation or termination of Non-Equitized PIPR Units pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the applicable Member shall be entitled to replacement awards with similar potential fair value, as determined by the Compensation Committee reasonably and in good faith (for the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that the “similar potential fair value” of a Non-Equitized PIPR Unit shall be determined taking into account, among other factors, the difference between the PIPR Capital with respect to such PIPR Unit and the Equitizing Target Capital and/or Parity Shortfall Amount with respect to such PIPR Unit).  Any PIPR Units of any Member may also be forfeited, canceled or terminated under any other circumstances as set forth in the relevant PIPR Agreement, including any failure to satisfy the relevant vesting conditions and any breach of restrictive covenants applicable to such PIPR Units.  A Member’s PIPR Capital with respect to a PIPR Unit that is forfeited, canceled or terminated shall be allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Members (other than the Profit Participation Members) pro rata in accordance with their Units (including Deemed Common Units) as of the end of such Accounting Period; provided that no such allocation shall be made to the PIPR Capital Account of PIPR Units that were not outstanding on the date of the original issuance of the forfeited, canceled or terminated PIPR Unit.

SECTION 4.04.Admission and Withdrawal of Members.  (a) Common Members. (i) Any recipient of a Common Interest pursuant to Section 4.03(a) or Section 7.02(a) who is not a Common Member at the time of such issuance or such Transfer, as applicable, shall be admitted as an additional Common Member and shall be listed as a “Common Member” on Schedule 1.01(a), and the issuance or Transfer, as applicable, of the Common Interest shall be effective upon the execution and delivery to the Company by such recipient of an agreement in which such person agrees to be bound by this Agreement and any other agreements, documents or instruments specified by the Managing Members or the Lazard Board; provided, however, that a recipient who is not a Common Member at the time of such issuance or Transfer, as applicable, shall only be admitted as an additional Common Member with the prior approval of the Lazard Board or the Lazard Ltd Board.

(ii)Effective immediately upon the Transfer of a Common Member’s entire Common Interest as provided in Section 7.02(a), such Member shall cease to have any interest in the profits, losses, assets, properties or capital of the Company and shall cease to be a Common Member.

(b)Profit Participation Members.  (i) Schedule 4.01 sets forth the identity and current Profit Participation Interest of each Profit Participation Member.  The Company may, by action of the Managing Members or the Lazard Board, from time to time admit additional Managing Directors as Profit Participation Members and may grant such persons Profit Participation Interests; provided that such additional Profit Participation Members properly execute and return an Acknowledgement.  Schedule 4.01 shall be amended pursuant to

 

 

20

[[6065250]]

 

Section 1.03 to reflect any change in identity of the Profit Participation Members and the Profit Participation Interests in accordance with this Agreement.

(ii)Effective immediately upon the earliest of (A) Retirement of a Profit Participation Member or (B) termination of the Profit Participation Interests as provided in Section 4.03(b)(iii), such Member (or his estate) shall cease to have any interest in the profits, losses, assets, properties or capital of the Company (other than (1) in respect of such former Profit Participation Member’s Profit Participation Capital and the right to receive any distributions in respect of such Profit Participation Capital to the extent provided in Section 8.03, and (2) if such Member is a PIPR Member, such Member’s PIPR Interest) and shall cease to be a Profit Participation Member; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall any Profit Participation Member be entitled to receive or otherwise be distributed any of the Profit Participation Capital associated with such Member’s Profit Participation Interest in the event of the occurrence of any of the events set forth in clause (A) or (B) of this sentence, which Profit Participation Capital shall thereafter represent solely the right to receive distributions of such Profit Participation Capital to the extent provided in Section 8.03.  Upon the Retirement of a Profit Participation Member or other termination of a Profit Participation Interest, the Profit Participation Percentage associated with such Member’s Profit Participation Interest shall cease to be allocated and become part of the Unallocated Float.

(c)PIPR Members.

The PIPR Units of each PIPR Member shall be set forth in Schedule 4.03(c).  Schedule 4.03(c) shall be amended pursuant to Section 1.03 to reflect any change in the identity of any PIPR Member or the PIPR Units held by any PIPR Member in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable PIPR Agreement.

Such admission shall be deemed effective immediately prior to the resignation, and, immediately following such admission, the resigning Managing Member shall cease to be a member of the Company (but, if applicable, shall otherwise remain a Member with respect to its Interests). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that there shall be two Managing Members, the resigning Managing Member may, in lieu of appointing a new Managing Member in accordance with this Section 4.04(d), designate the remaining Managing Member as the sole Managing Member.

(v)fifth, a net amount of operating Profit or Loss, as the case may be, derived by or with respect to each entity set forth on Schedule A shall be allocated to the Common Members in proportion to the ratio set forth for each Common Member on Schedule A with respect to such entity as of the end of such Accounting Period;

(vi)sixth, a net amount of operating Profit or Loss, as the case may be, derived by or with respect to each Unallocated Entity (if any) shall be allocated to the Common Members in proportion to their respective Funding Proportions with respect to such Unallocated Entity as of the end of such Accounting Period; and

(vii)thereafter, a net amount of Profit or Loss, as the case may be, shall be allocated to the Common Members in proportion to their respective Common Percentage Interests as of the end of such Accounting Period.

Schedule A may be revised from time to time by action of the Managing Members; provided that any such revisions shall be consistent with the principles set forth in Section 5.04(d)(ii).  Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.02 to the contrary, any such revision shall not be deemed an amendment to this Agreement, and shall not require any act, vote or approval of any person.

(c)For purposes of this Agreement:

(i)“Fixed Percentage” means 12%; provided, however, that in the event that the Profit Participation Amount would in any Accounting Period exceed the product of (1) 6% and (2) the Operating Revenue for such Accounting Period (such product, the “Cap”), the Fixed Percentage shall, for such Accounting Period, be an amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Cap and the denominator of which shall be the Operating Income, in each case for such Accounting Period;

(ii)“Operating Expenses” means, with respect to any Accounting Period, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the consolidated expenses of the Company over (2) the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of compensation paid or payable to Managing Directors, (b) all minority interest, (c) all interest expense (but excluding all “operating” interest expense, including in respect of Lazard Frères Banque S.A.), (d) all income taxes, and (e) all extraordinary losses, in each case as determined in accordance with generally

 

 

25

[[6065250]]

 

accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and otherwise in accordance with Section 5.05.  For the avoidance of doubt, “Operating Expense” shall exclude amounts allocable to Profit Participation Members in respect of their Profit Participation Interests;

(iii)“Operating Income” means, with respect to any Accounting Period, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the Operating Revenue over (2) the Operating Expenses, in each case for such Accounting Period;

(iv)“Operating Revenue” means, with respect to any Accounting Period, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the sum of (a) the consolidated net revenue of the Company and (b) all interest expense (but excluding all “operating” interest expense, including in respect of Lazard Frères Banque S.A.), over (2) all extraordinary gains, in each case as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and otherwise in accordance with Section 5.05; and

(v)“Profit Participation Amount” means, with respect to any Accounting Period, an amount equal to the product of (1) the Fixed Percentage and (2) the Operating Income, in each case for such Accounting Period.

In any calculation of Operating Income, all gains and losses arising from the sale of a business segment or a significant asset outside the ordinary course of business shall be excluded from Operating Revenue and Operating Expense, as applicable.

(d)Future Acquisitions.  (i) In the event the Company or one of its Subsidiaries acquires an entity and the Managing Members do not revise Schedule A or Schedule B to reflect such entity, such entity shall be an “Unallocated Entity”.  The Managing Members shall determine the “Funding Proportion” of each Common Member with respect to each Unallocated Entity in accordance with the principles set forth in Section 5.04(d)(ii).

(ii)Any revisions to Schedule A or Schedule B to reflect any acquired entity, and any determination of a Funding Proportion pursuant to Section 5.04(d)(i), shall reflect each Common Member’s economic investment with respect to the relevant entity relative to each other Common Member, as determined in good faith and taking into account (A) any adjustments to the Common Members’ respective Common Percentage Interests that result from transactions related to the acquisition of such entity, including pursuant to Section 4.03, (B) any portion of the consideration for the relevant entity provided by the Company and (C) any other relevant information.  Determinations made in accordance with the principles set forth in this Section 5.04(d)(ii), and the allocations of Profit or Loss, as the case may be, that result therefrom, are intended to comply with Treasury Regulation section 1.704-1(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent therewith.

 

 

26

[[6065250]]

 

(e)Revaluation Gain.  For purposes of computing Capital Accounts, Revaluation Gain with respect to each Accounting Period shall be allocated in accordance with Section 5.04(g) and in the following order and priority:

(i)first, pro rata among the Equitized PIPR Units until the PIPR Capital of such Equitized PIPR Units equals the Common Parity Amount;

(ii)second, pro rata among the Service and Performance Vested PIPR Units that are Non-Equitized PIPR Units until the PIPR Capital of such Service and Performance Vested PIPR Units equals the Common Parity Amount;

(iii)third, pro rata among the Unvested PIPR Units that are Non-Equitized PIPR Units until the PIPR Capital of such Unvested PIPR Units equals the Common Parity Amount; and

(iv)thereafter, to the Members (other than the Profit Participation Members) pro rata in accordance with their Units (including Deemed Common Units) as of the end of such Accounting Period.

The purpose of this Section 5.04(e) is to allocate Revaluation Gain so that (x) each PIPR Unit becomes an Equitized PIPR Unit when the PIPR Capital of such PIPR Unit equals the Common Capital Account balance of a Deemed Common Unit and (y) each PIPR Unit has, as of the Revaluation immediately preceding the exchange of such PIPR Unit pursuant to Section 7.03, PIPR Capital equal to the Common Parity Amount.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Managing Members and the Compensation Committee shall apply this Section 5.04(e) in a manner consistent with this purpose.  

(f)Revaluation Loss.  For purposes of computing Capital Accounts, in accordance with Section 5.04(g), Revaluation Loss with respect to each Accounting Period shall be allocated to the Members (other than the Profit Participation Members) pro rata in accordance with their Units (including Deemed Common Units) as of the end of such Accounting Period; provided that, to the extent the allocation of Revaluation Loss would cause the PIPR Capital (determined, for purposes of this Section 5.04(f), without regard to clause (ii) of the definition of PIPR Capital) with respect to a PIPR Unit to be less than zero, such Revaluation Loss shall instead be allocated (i) first, to the Common Members pro rata in accordance with their Common Capital Account balances (increased, for purposes of this Section 5.04(f), by the amount of each Common Member’s share of any partnership minimum gain and any partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (in each case, as defined and determined by Treasury Regulation section 1.704-2)) until the aggregate total of the Common Capital Account balances is zero, (ii) second, to the PIPR Members pro rata in proportion to their PIPR Units until the aggregate total of the PIPR Capital Account balances is zero and (iii) thereafter, to the Profit Participation Members pro rata in accordance with their Profit Participation Percentages until the aggregate total of the Profit Participation Capital Account balances (increased, for purposes of this Section 5.04(f), by the amount of each Profit Participation Partner’s share of any partnership minimum gain and any partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (in each case, as defined and determined by Treasury Regulation section 1.704-2)) is zero.  If the allocation of Revaluation Loss causes the Common Capital Account balance with respect to a Deemed Common Unit to be less than the Equitizing

 

 

27

[[6065250]]

 

Target Capital with respect to a PIPR Unit immediately before such allocation, then the Equitizing Target Capital with respect to such PIPR Unit shall be adjusted to equal the Common Capital Account balance with respect to a Deemed Common Unit immediately after such allocation.

(g)Additional Allocation Rules.  (i) Unit-by-Unit Allocations.  Allocations pursuant to Sections 5.04(e)(i), (ii) and (iii) shall be made on a Unit-by-Unit basis, in order of Grant Date (starting with the earliest), such that Revaluation Gain is allocated entirely to the longest-outstanding PIPR Unit until it is an Equitized PIPR Unit, then entirely to the next longest-outstanding PIPR Unit until it is an Equitized PIPR Unit, and so on.

(ii)Excluded Items.  Excluded Items derived by or with respect to (A) each entity set forth on Schedule A or Schedule B shall be allocated to the Common Members in proportion to the ratio set forth for each Common Member on Schedule A or Schedule B, as applicable, and (B) an entity not set forth on Schedule A or Schedule B shall be allocated to the Common Members pro rata in accordance with their respective Common Percentage Interests.

(iii)Insufficient Profit to Make Certain Allocations.  If, in any Accounting Period, there is not enough Profit to allocate the full amount that would otherwise be allocated pursuant to Sections 5.04(a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) or Sections 5.04(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) (as applicable), then additional allocations shall be made in subsequent periods to make up for the shortfall.

(iv)Forfeiture Allocations.  If any Member is required to irrevocably return any amount previously received as a distribution or is required to forfeit any PIPR Units pursuant to Section 4.03(c)(iv), the Company shall allocate Loss (or items of loss or deduction) to such Member in an amount equal to the returned distribution or the PIPR Capital allocable to such forfeited PIPR Units to reverse prior allocations of Profit to such Member, as applicable.

(v)Certain Parity Shortfall Amount Allocations.  If a PIPR Unit is converted into a Common Interest pursuant to Section 7.03(d) and the PIPR Capital with respect to such PIPR Unit is less than the Common Capital Account balance of a Deemed Common Unit immediately before the conversion (the difference, an “Actual Parity Shortfall Amount”), then the Member holding the Common Interest into which such PIPR Unit was converted shall share pro rata in allocations under Section 5.04(e)(i) until such Member has been allocated an amount equal to the Actual Parity Shortfall Amount.

(vi)Managing Member Determination With Respect to Revaluation Loss.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Managing Members may determine that Revaluation Loss shall, before any allocation is made pursuant to Section 5.04(f), be allocated among the Members to reverse prior allocations of Revaluation Gain in any manner reasonably determined by the Managing Members.

(h)Regulatory Allocations.  Each of (i) the “minimum gain chargeback” provision of Treasury Regulation section 1.704-2(f), (ii) the “chargeback of partner nonrecourse

 

 

28

[[6065250]]

 

debt minimum gain” provision of Treasury Regulation section 1.704-2(i)(4), (iii) the “qualified income offset” provision in Treasury Regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), and (iv) the requirement in Treasury Regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(3) that an allocation “not cause or increase a deficit balance” in a Member’s Capital Account is hereby incorporated by reference as a part of this Agreement.  Nonrecourse deductions shall be allocated in any manner determined by the Managing Members in accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.704-2.  Partner nonrecourse deductions shall be allocated to the Member who bears the economic risk of loss (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.752-2) with respect to the partner nonrecourse debt to which such partner nonrecourse deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.704-2(i)(1).

(i)Tax Allocations.  Except as otherwise required under Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, the Company shall cause each item of income, gain, loss or deduction recognized by the Company to be allocated among the Members for U.S. Federal, state and local income and, where relevant, non-U.S. tax purposes in the same manner that each such item is allocated to the Members’ Capital Accounts or as otherwise provided herein.  Allocations required by Section 704(c) of the Code shall be made using any reasonable method permitted by the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(c) of the Code.

SECTION 5.05.Determinations.  All determinations, allocations, valuations and other matters of judgment required to be made for purposes of this Article V, including with respect to calculations of Profit Participation Amount, Operating Revenue, Operating Expenses, Revaluation Gain, Revaluation Loss and accounting procedures and tax matters not expressly provided for by the terms of this Agreement, or for determining the value of any type or form of proceeds, contribution or distributions hereunder shall be made by the Managing Members.  In the event an additional Member is admitted to the Company and contributes property to the Company, or an existing Member contributes additional property to the Company, pursuant to this Agreement, the value of such contributed property shall be the fair market value of such property as determined by the Managing Members.  The Managing Members may, in their sole discretion, determine that a Revaluation shall be carried out in connection with a Change in Control.

SECTION 5.06.Books and Accounts.  (a) The Company shall at all times keep or cause to be kept true and complete records and books of account, which records and books shall be maintained in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Such records and books of account shall be kept at the principal place of business of the Company.  The Managing Members and the Lazard Board shall have access thereto and the right to receive copies thereof.  As permitted by Section 18-305(g) of the Act, no Member shall be entitled to review such records and books of account (including any of the schedules hereto) unless the Managing Members or the Lazard Board, in its sole discretion, shall permit such review.  The Company’s accounts shall be maintained in United States dollars.

(b)The Company’s fiscal year shall begin on the first day of January and end on the thirty-first day of December of each year, or shall be such other period designated by the Managing Members or the Lazard Board.  At the end of each fiscal year, the Company’s

 

 

29

[[6065250]]

 

accounts shall be prepared, presented to the Managing Members or the Lazard Board and submitted to the Company’s auditors for examination.

(c)The Company’s auditors shall be an independent accounting firm of international reputation to be appointed from time to time by the Lazard Board or the Managing Members.  The Company’s auditors shall be entitled to receive promptly such information, accounts and explanations from the Lazard Board, each officer and each Member that they deem reasonably necessary to carry out their duties.  The Members shall provide such financial, tax and other information to the Company as may be reasonably necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Company.

SECTION 5.07.Audits; Tax Representative.  (a) Lazard Ltd Sub B is hereby designated as the Tax Representative.  Lazard Ltd Sub B shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to (i) make an election under Section 754 of the Code on behalf of the Company, and each Member agrees to provide such information and documentation as Lazard Ltd Sub B may reasonably request in connection with any such election, (ii) determine the manner in which “excess nonrecourse liabilities” (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.752-3(a)(3)) are allocated among the Members, (iii) take any and all actions permitted by Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, including an election under Section 6226 of the Code, and (iv) make any other election or determination with respect to taxes (including with respect to depreciation, amortization and accounting methods).  

(b)Each Member shall cooperate with Lazard Ltd Sub B and promptly provide any information reasonably requested by Lazard Ltd Sub B in connection with its exercise of its rights and obligations under this Section 5.07.  Any Member that enters into an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service with respect to any item of the Company shall notify Lazard Ltd Sub B of such agreement and its terms within thirty (30) days of the execution of such agreement.  

(c)If the Company pays any taxes (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax and any related state or local or non-U.S. taxes) under Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (“Audit Taxes”), Lazard Ltd Sub B shall use its sole discretion to allocate Audit Taxes among the Members.  If requested by Lazard Ltd Sub B, each Member shall promptly pay to the Company any Audit Taxes allocated to such Member under this Section 5.07(c).  Alternatively, the Company may treat any Audit Taxes allocated to a Member under this Section 5.07(c) as an advance to such Member to be repaid by reducing the amount of distributions that would otherwise be made to such Member under this Agreement; provided that such Member shall be treated as receiving such distributions, unreduced by this Section 5.07(c), for all other purposes of this Agreement.

(d)This Section 5.07 shall survive any Transfer by any Member and any dissolution of the Company, and, solely for purposes of this Section 5.07, references to any Member or Members may (as determined by Lazard Ltd Sub B in its sole discretion) include any former Member or Members.

SECTION 5.08.Tax Information.  The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and deliver, as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of each taxable year of the Company, to each Member (other than the Managing Member and each other person that was such a Member during such taxable year or its legal representatives) U.S. Internal Revenue Service Schedule K-1, “Partner’s Share of Income, Credits, Deductions, Etc.”, or any successor schedule or form, for such person.

SECTION 5.09.Withholding.  The Company is authorized to withhold from distributions and allocations to the Members and to pay over to any U.S. Federal, state, local or foreign governmental authority any amounts believed in good faith to be so withheld pursuant to the Code or any provision of any other U.S. Federal, state, local or foreign law and, for all purposes of this Agreement, shall treat such amounts as distributed to those Members with respect to which such amounts were withheld.

ARTICLE VI

DISTRIBUTIONS

SECTION 6.01.Distributions in Respect of Profit Participation Interests.  (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.01(a), the Company shall distribute to each Profit Participation Member from such Member’s Profit Participation Capital Account as promptly as practicable after the end of each of the first three (3) fiscal quarters of each fiscal year of the Company or relevant estimated tax payment date an amount equal to such Profit Participation Member’s Quarterly Profit Participation Tax Distribution for such fiscal quarter.  In addition, the Company shall distribute to each Profit Participation Member from such Member’s Profit Participation Capital Account as promptly as practicable after the end of each fiscal year an amount equal to the excess, if any, of such Profit Participation Member’s Proportionate Tax Share for such fiscal year over the aggregate amount of Quarterly Profit Participation Tax Distributions made to such Profit Participation Member with respect to such fiscal year.  If, at the end of any fiscal year of the Company, the aggregate amount of Quarterly Profit Participation Tax Distributions made to a Profit Participation Member exceeds such Profit Participation Member’s Proportionate Tax Share, in each case with respect to such fiscal year, then the amount of such excess shall be treated as an advance against, and shall reduce the amount of, any future distributions that would otherwise be made to such Member pursuant to this Section 6.01(a).  Any amount distributed to a Profit Participation Member pursuant to this Section 6.01(a) shall be treated as an advance against, and shall reduce the amount of, any future distributions that would otherwise be made to such Member pursuant to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Member is not entitled to any future distributions pursuant to this Agreement, then the Company shall be permitted to require the Member to repay the Company the amount of such advance; provided, however, that, if the Member is an Executive Officer, the Company shall not require repayment of such advance if it would violate Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and instead, such Member shall use reasonable best efforts to claim any tax benefit related to such advance that the Company reasonably determines is available to the Member on all relevant tax returns and shall disgorge to the Company any tax benefit the Member so realizes.

 

 

31

[[6065250]]

 

(b)The Company shall, after the end of each fiscal year, distribute to each Profit Participation Member an amount (if positive) equal to the aggregate of all Profit Participation Amounts allocated to such Member’s Profit Participation Capital Account pursuant to Section 5.04(a)(i) or Section 5.04(b)(i), as the case may be, during such fiscal year (reduced by the amount of any distributions pursuant to Section 6.01(a)), with such distribution to occur on such date and time as determined by the Company; provided that no distribution shall be made to such person pursuant to this Section 6.01(b) unless such person shall continue to be a Profit Participation Member as of the date and time of distribution; provided, further, that distributions pursuant to this Section 6.01(b) shall be made to a Profit Participation Member only to the extent of the positive balance in such Member’s Profit Participation Capital Account unless otherwise determined by the Lazard Board.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may (i) withhold all or a portion of the distributions otherwise payable to any Profit Participation Member pursuant to the immediately foregoing sentence, or (ii) distribute to any Profit Participation Member all or a portion of the positive balance, if any, in such Member’s Profit Participation Capital Account as of the end of the applicable fiscal year (after giving effect to (A) the allocations pursuant to Section 5.04(a)(i) or Section 5.04(b)(i), as the case may be, with respect to the Accounting Period ending on December 31 of such fiscal year and (B) any distributions pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.01(b)).

SECTION 6.02.Tax Distributions.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.02, the Company shall distribute to each Common Member and each PIPR Member as promptly as practicable after the end of each of the first three (3) fiscal quarters of each fiscal year of the Company or relevant estimated tax payment date an amount equal to such Member’s Quarterly Tax Distribution for such fiscal quarter.  In addition, the Company shall distribute to each Common Member and each PIPR Member as promptly as practicable after the end of each fiscal year an amount equal to the excess, if any, of such Member’s Proportionate Tax Share for such fiscal year over the aggregate amount of Quarterly Tax Distributions made to such Member with respect to such fiscal year.  If, at the end of any fiscal year of the Company, the aggregate amount of Quarterly Tax Distributions made to a Common Member or a PIPR Member exceeds such Member’s Proportionate Tax Share, in each case with respect to such fiscal year, then the amount of such excess shall be treated as an advance against, and shall reduce the amount of, any future distributions that would otherwise be made to such Member pursuant to this Section 6.02. Any amount distributed to a Common Member or a PIPR Member, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be treated as an advance against, and shall reduce the amount of, any future distributions that would otherwise be made to such Member pursuant to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Member is not entitled to any future distributions pursuant to this Agreement, then, except as otherwise set forth in the applicable PIPR Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to require the Member to repay the Company the amount of such advance; provided, however, that, if the Member is an Executive Officer, the Company shall not require repayment of such advance if it would violate Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and, instead, such Member shall use reasonable best efforts to claim any tax benefit related to such advance that the Company reasonably determines is available to the Member on all relevant tax returns and shall disgorge to the Company any tax benefit the Member so realizes.

SECTION 6.03.Regular Distributions.  (a) Generally.  The Lazard Board shall have the right to cause the Company to make distributions to any Common Member (from

 

 

32

[[6065250]]

 

such Member’s Common Capital Account) and PIPR Member (from such Member’s PIPR Capital Account) at such times, and in such amounts, as may be determined by the Lazard Board in its sole discretion; provided that no such distribution to a Common Member or PIPR Member shall exceed such Member’s Common Capital Account or PIPR Capital Account, respectively, immediately before such distribution.  Distributions to the Common Members pursuant to this Section 6.03(a) need not be made on a pro rata basis.

(b)PIPR Units.  Except as provided in the applicable PIPR Agreement, the Company shall make cash distributions with respect to each PIPR Unit in an amount equal to the amount of cash dividends paid on Lazard Ltd Common Stock (the right to such distributions shall be deemed to accrue on the record date for such dividends), calculated as if (i) each outstanding Performance PIPR had been exchanged, immediately prior to such record date, into a fraction of a share of Lazard Ltd Common Stock equal to the applicable Specified Percentage and (ii) all other outstanding PIPR Units had been exchanged, immediately prior to such record date, into one share of Lazard Ltd Common Stock; provided that any amount that would otherwise be distributed with respect to an Unvested PIPR Unit under this Section 6.03(b) shall be retained by the Company and shall not be distributed unless and until such Unvested PIPR Unit becomes a Service and Performance Vested PIPR Unit.

(c)Performance PIPR True-Up.  Reasonably promptly after the date on which a Performance PIPR becomes a PIPR Unit that is no longer a Performance PIPR (a “Performance Achievement PIPR”), the Company shall make a distribution to the applicable PIPR Member in respect of such PIPR Unit in an amount (not less than zero) equal to (i) the amount of distributions that would have been made with respect to such PIPR Unit under Section 6.03(b) if the Specified Percentage applicable to such PIPR Unit had been 100% at all times during the period between its Grant Date and the date on which it ceased to be a Performance PIPR reduced by (ii) the amount, if any, of actual distributions made with respect to such PIPR Unit with respect to such period and further reduced by (iii) without duplication of any amounts described in clause (ii), the amount, if any, of (A) the aggregate tax distributions made pursuant to Section 6.02 in respect of such PIPR Member’s Performance PIPRs that were granted on the same Grant Date as the relevant PIPR Unit but did not become Performance Achievement PIPRs, divided by (B) the total number of PIPR Units (including such PIPR Unit) with the same Grant Date as such PIPR Unit that became Performance Achievement PIPRs; provided that any amount that would otherwise be distributed with respect to an Unvested PIPR Unit under this Section 6.03(c) shall be retained by the Company and shall not be distributed unless and until such Unvested PIPR Unit becomes a Service and Performance Vested PIPR Unit.

(d)PIPR Accrued Return.  A return (at a rate of 6%, compounded quarterly, or such other rate as specified by the Managing Members from time to time) shall accrue on (i) the net amount of Profit allocated to the PIPR Members under Section 5.04(b)(ii) (during the Effective Period) or Section 5.04(a)(ii) (after the Effective Period) plus (ii) the net amount of Profit allocated to the PIPR Members under Section 5.04(b)(iii) (during the Effective Period) or Section 5.04(a)(iii) (after the Effective Period), in each case, from the date that the related cash dividend on the Lazard Ltd Common Stock is paid to holders of the Lazard Ltd Common Stock until the date such Profits are distributed to the PIPR Members under Section 6.02, Section 6.03(b) or Section 6.03(c).  The Company shall distribute an amount equal to such return to the applicable PIPR Member in cash at the same time it pays the relevant distributions to such PIPR Member.

[[6065250]]

 

SECTION 6.04.Limitation on Distributions.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, and the Lazard Board on behalf of the Company, shall not be required to make a distribution to a Member on account of its interest in the Company if such distribution would violate the Act or any other applicable law.

ARTICLE VII

TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS

SECTION 7.01.Transfer of Interests.  No Member may Transfer or agree or otherwise commit to Transfer all or any portion of, or any of rights, title and interest in and to, its Interest, except as permitted by the terms and conditions set forth in this Article VII.  The schedules shall be deemed to be amended from time to time to reflect any change in the Members or Interests to reflect any Transfer in accordance with this Article VII.

SECTION 7.02.Permitted Transfers.  (a) Common Interests.  Other than any Transfer by a Common Member to any other Common Member or to any person who is admitted as an additional Common Member in accordance with Section 4.04(a) of this Agreement, no Common Member may Transfer or agree or otherwise commit to Transfer all or any portion of, or any of its rights, title and interest in and to, its Common Interest without the prior approval of the Lazard Board.  Schedule 1.01(a) sets forth the Common Percentage Interest of each of the Common Members.  Such schedule shall be amended pursuant to Section 1.03 to reflect any Transfer of Common Interests in accordance with this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, a Transferee pursuant to any Transfer under this Section 7.02(a) who is not a Common Member at the time of such Transfer shall be admitted as an additional Common Member, and shall be listed as a “Common Member” on Schedule 1.01(a), only in accordance with Section 4.04(a).

(b)Profit Participation Interests.  No Profit Participation Member may Transfer or agree or otherwise commit to Transfer all or any portion of, or any of its rights, title and interest in and to, its Profit Participation Interest.

(c)PIPR Units.  No PIPR Member may Transfer or agree or otherwise commit to Transfer all or any portion of, or any of its rights, title and interest in and to, its PIPR Interest other than (i) an exchange pursuant to Section 7.03, (ii) upon the death of such Member, a Transfer by operation of law to such Member’s estate, direct descendants or spouse, (iii) to an Affiliate of the Company in exchange solely for equity interests in such Affiliate or (iv) a Transfer for which the Managing Members have provided prior approval in their sole discretion.  A Transferee pursuant to any Transfer under this Section 7.02(c) who is not a PIPR Member at the time of such Transfer shall be admitted as a PIPR Member and Schedule 4.03(c) shall be updated to reflect such Transfer.

(d)Transfer of Capital Accounts.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Member who Transfers an Interest (or a portion thereof) shall be deemed to have Transferred the entire Interest, including the balance in the Capital Account with respect to such Interest (or, if a portion of an Interest is being Transferred, a proportionate amount of the balance in the Capital Account with respect to such Interest) to the Transferee.

SECTION 7.03.PIPR Unit Exchange.  (a) Generally.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each PIPR Member holding a Service and Performance Vested PIPR Unit that is an Equitized PIPR Unit that is in Parity (an “Exchangeable PIPR Unit”) shall have the right to require the Company to redeem such Exchangeable PIPR Unit in exchange for one share of Lazard Ltd Common Stock on the next redemption date selected by the Company; provided that, if such PIPR Member has not exercised that right before the end of the second month following the end of the fiscal quarter in which such PIPR Unit became an Exchangeable PIPR Unit, the Company shall redeem such Exchangeable PIPR Unit in exchange for one share of Lazard Ltd Common Stock.  Lazard Ltd (and/or its Subsidiaries) shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase directly from an exchanging Member some or all of the Exchangeable PIPR Units to be exchanged upon the same terms and conditions set forth in the preceding sentence.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be permitted to defer any exchange of an Exchangeable PIPR Unit for Lazard Ltd Common Stock if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that such deferral is necessary or appropriate due to regulatory restrictions, a change in law or any event outside the ordinary course of business; provided that in no event shall the Company defer an exchange beyond the end of the second month following the end of the calendar year in which the PIPR Unit became an Exchangeable PIPR Unit.

(b)Exchange Limitation.  For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement or any PIPR Agreement, no PIPR Unit may be exchanged for a share of Lazard Ltd Common Stock under this Section 7.03 unless such PIPR Unit is an Equitized PIPR Unit that is in Parity.  Notwithstanding the limitation in the preceding sentence and the first sentence of Section 7.03(a), if a PIPR Unit is not an Exchangeable PIPR Unit solely because it is not in Parity, the Company may treat that PIPR Unit as an Exchangeable PIPR Unit if the PIPR Member holding such PIPR Unit agrees to pay the Parity Shortfall Amount (i) to the Company, if the PIPR Unit is to be redeemed by the Company, or (ii) to the purchaser of the PIPR Unit, if the PIPR Unit is to be purchased pursuant to the penultimate sentence of Section 7.03(a).  The payment required by the preceding sentence shall be made in cash unless the Managing Members permit the PIPR Member to pay the Parity Shortfall Amount by surrendering PIPR Units of equivalent value, as determined by the Managing Members.

(c)Unvested PIPR Units.  Subject to Section 7.03(b) and the applicable PIPR Agreement, the Company shall have the right to require a Member to exchange any or all of such Member’s Unvested PIPR Units that are Equitized PIPR Units for shares of Lazard Ltd Common Stock if the Compensation Committee determines that it is in the best interests of the Company or any of its Affiliates due to accounting, regulatory, tax, strategic planning or other reasons; provided that such shares of Lazard Ltd Common Stock shall remain subject to the vesting conditions that were applicable to such Unvested PIPR Unit as set forth in the relevant PIPR Agreement.  Any shares of Lazard Ltd Common Stock received in exchange for Unvested PIPR Units may contain a restrictive legend and may have other restrictions in accordance with the terms of the applicable PIPR Agreement.

(d)Consequence of Exchange.  Upon the purchase of a PIPR Unit as provided in the second sentence of Section 7.03(a) in exchange for a share of Lazard Ltd Common Stock, such PIPR Unit shall automatically convert into a Common Interest, the PIPR Capital with

 

 

35

[[6065250]]

 

respect to such PIPR Unit shall become the Common Capital Account balance of the Deemed Common Unit, and such PIPR Unit shall be canceled and shall cease to exist.

(e)Notice.  The Company shall deliver written notice to the applicable Member setting forth the procedures and terms related to an exchange under this Section 7.03.

(f)No Publicly Traded Partnership.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement or any PIPR Agreement, no exchange pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall be permitted (and, if attempted, shall be null and of no effect) if the Company determines, in the sole discretion of the Managing Members, that such exchange would pose a material risk that the Company would be a “publicly traded partnership” as defined in Section 7704 of the Code.  In the event the Company makes such a determination, an exchange pursuant to Section 7.03(a) shall be permitted upon the next redemption date selected by the Company that would not pose such a risk.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Managing Members, in their sole discretion, shall be permitted to establish procedures that they determine are necessary or appropriate to ensure that the Company will not be treated as a “publicly traded partnership” or as an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.

SECTION 7.04.Encumbrances.  No Member (other than Lazard Ltd or one of its Subsidiaries) may, without the consent of the Company, charge or encumber his Interest or subject his Interest to a lien, pledge, security interest, right of first refusal, option or other similar limitation (an “Encumbrance”) except in each case for those created by this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Article VII, the incurrence of any Encumbrance permitted by this Section 7.04 shall not be deemed to be a Transfer.

SECTION 7.05.Legend.  Each Member agrees that any certificate issued to it to evidence its Interests shall have inscribed conspicuously on its front or back the following legend:

THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY INTEREST IN LAZARD GROUP LLC REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR REGISTERED OR QUALIFIED UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR FOREIGN JURISDICTION, AND THIS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY INTEREST MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, EXCEPT (A) EITHER (1) WHILE A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND SUCH OTHER APPLICABLE REGISTRATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS ARE IN EFFECT OR (2) PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (INCLUDING, IF APPLICABLE, REGULATION D OR REGULATION S THEREUNDER) AND SUCH OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS AND (B) IF PERMITTED BY THE OPERATING AGREEMENT OF LAZARD GROUP LLC AS IT MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, WHICH CONTAINS STRICT PROHIBITIONS ON TRANSFERS, SALES, ASSIGNMENTS, PLEDGES,

HYPOTHECATIONS, ENCUMBRANCES OR OTHER DISPOSITIONS OF THIS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY INTEREST.

SECTION 7.06.Effect of Transfer Not in Compliance with This Article.  Any purported Transfer of all or any part of a Member’s Interest, or any interest therein, that is not in compliance with this Article VII shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be void and shall be of no effect.

ARTICLE VIII

Subject to clause (b) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall not be dissolved solely by reason of, and shall continue notwithstanding, the death, Retirement, resignation, bankruptcy or dissolution of any Member (including any Managing Member).  None of the Members shall have any right to terminate, dissolve or have redeemed their class of Interests or, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to terminate, wind up or dissolve the Company.

SECTION 8.02.Liquidation.  Upon a dissolution pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company’s business and assets shall be wound up promptly in an orderly manner.

Upon completion of the winding-up of the Company, the Lazard Board shall prepare and submit to each Common Member a final statement with respect thereto.

ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION AND EXCULPATION

SECTION 9.01.Exculpation.  A Director shall not be personally liable to the Company or its Members for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the Act as the same exists or may hereafter be amended.  Any repeal or modification of the immediately preceding sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a Director existing hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

SECTION 9.02.Indemnification.  (a) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was (i) a Director or officer of the Company, (ii) a director or officer of Lazard Ltd or (iii) serving at the request of the Company (including as evidenced in a written letter signed by a proper officer of the Company) as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or person, including the Tax Representative (and any “designated individual” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 301.6223-1(b)(3)(ii)) and service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Company, in each case whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a Director, director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a Director, director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment), if the Company were a corporation organized under the DGCL, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 9.02(c), the Company shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Lazard Board. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section 9.02 shall be a contract right.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Section 9.02 in the case of any Director or officer of the

 

 

38

[[6065250]]

 

Company or any director or officer of Lazard Ltd shall include (and, in the case of any other person entitled to indemnification hereunder, may at the option of the Chief Executive Officer, General Counsel or the Lazard Board include) the right to be paid by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such advances to be paid by the Company within twenty (20) days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by any such person in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 9.02 or otherwise.

(b)To obtain indemnification under this Section 9.02, a claimant shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification.  Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 9.02(b), a determination, if required by the DGCL if the Company were a corporation organized under the DGCL, with respect to the claimant’s entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (i) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (ii) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, by the Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel of the Company, whose determination shall be approved by the Lazard Board (by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined)); provided that (A) if a quorum of the Lazard Board consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, such determination shall be approved by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Lazard Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (B) if a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, such determination shall be approved by the Common Members on a unanimous basis.  In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Lazard Board unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the Proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change in Control, in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Lazard Board.  If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.

(c)If a claim under Section 9.02(a) is not paid in full by the Company within thirty (30) days after a written claim pursuant to Section 9.02(b) has been received by the Company, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Company) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct that makes it permissible under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in

 

 

39

[[6065250]]

 

the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment) for the Company to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed if the Company were a corporation organized under the DGCL, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Company.  Neither the failure of the Company (including the Lazard Board, Independent Counsel or Common Members) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Lazard Board, Independent Counsel or Common Members) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

(d)If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 9.02(b) that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Section 9.02(c).

(e)The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Section 9.02(c) that the procedures and presumptions of this Section 9.02 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Section 9.02.

(f)No amendment or other modification of this Section 9.02 or Section 9.03 shall in any way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any Director, officer, employee or agent of the Company hereunder in respect of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification.

(g)The Company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Lazard Board, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of the Company to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Section 9.02 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Directors and officers of the Company.

(h)If any provision or provisions of this Section 9.02 shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Section 9.02 (including each portion of any subsection of this Section 9.02 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Section 9.02 (including each such portion of any subsection of this Section 9.02 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

(i)“Disinterested Director” means a Director of the Company who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the claimant.

(ii)“Independent Counsel” means a law firm, a member of a law firm, or an independent practitioner, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and shall include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would not have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or the claimant in an action to determine the claimant’s rights under this Section 9.02.

(j)Any notice, request or other communication required or permitted to be given to the Company under this Section 9.02 shall be in writing and either delivered in person or sent by telecopy, telex, telegram, overnight mail or courier service, or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the General Counsel of the Company and shall be effective only upon receipt by the General Counsel.

SECTION 9.03.Non-Exclusivity of Rights.  The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article IX shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Agreement, agreement, vote of the Common Members or Disinterested Directors or otherwise.

SECTION 9.04.Insurance.  The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL if the Company were a corporation organized under the DGCL.

SECTION 9.05.Survival.  This Article IX shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

The two arbitrators designated by the parties to a Dispute (or, if applicable, the ICC) shall designate a third arbitrator.  In the event that the two arbitrators designated by the parties to a Dispute (or, if applicable, the ICC) are unable to agree upon a third arbitrator within a reasonable period, the third arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the ICC Rules by the ICC.  The language, place and procedures of the arbitration of any Dispute shall be as agreed upon by the parties to such Dispute or, failing such agreement within a reasonable period, as determined in accordance with the ICC Rules in order to ensure a speedy, efficient and just resolution of such Dispute.  If neither the parties nor the arbitral tribunal can agree upon procedures, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the ICC’s procedures.  The hearings and taking of evidence of any Dispute may be conducted at any locations that will, in the judgment of the arbitral tribunal, result in a speedy, efficient and just resolution of such Dispute.  The parties to any dispute shall use their best efforts to cooperate with each other and the arbitral tribunal in order to obtain a resolution as quickly as possible, including by adopting the ICC’s “fast-track” procedure (as provided for in Article 32(1) of the ICC Rules) if appropriate.

(d)Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 10.05 shall be construed to the maximum extent possible to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C. § 5701 et seq .) (the “Delaware Arbitration Act”).  If, nevertheless, it shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 10.05, including the ICC Rules, shall be invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware Arbitration Act or other applicable law, such invalidity shall not invalidate all of this Section 10.05.  In that case, this Section 10.05 shall be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 10.05 shall be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision.

SECTION 10.06.Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective estates, heirs, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns, any additional Member admitted in accordance with the provisions hereof and any successor to a trustee of a trust that is or becomes a party hereto.

SECTION 10.07.Confidentiality.  Each Member that is not a controlled Affiliate of Lazard Ltd expressly agrees, whether or not at the time a Member of the Company or providing services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not disclose to any person other than the Company, its officers or any financial, legal or other advisor to the Company, any information relating to the business, clients, affairs or financial structure, position or results of the Company or its affiliates (including any Affiliate) or any Dispute that shall not be generally known to the public or the securities industry; provided that such Member may disclose any such information (a) to the extent required by any applicable law, rule or regulation in the opinion of counsel or by the order of any securities exchange, banking supervisory authority or other governmental or self-regulatory organization of competent jurisdiction (provided that such Member notifies the Company of such requirement

Communications by telecopier also shall be sent concurrently by overnight courier, but shall in any event be effective as stated above.  Each Member and Director may from time to time change its address for notices under this Section 10.08 by giving at least five (5) days’ prior written notice of such changed address to the Company.

SECTION 10.09.No Waiver of Rights.  No failure or delay on the part of any Member in the exercise of any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right or power.  The waiver by any Member, Managing Member or Director of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach hereunder.  All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies otherwise available.

SECTION 10.10.Power of Attorney.  Each Member agrees that, by its execution of this Agreement, such Member irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Chief Executive Officer and the General Counsel, each acting alone, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact coupled with an interest, with full power and authority, in its name, place and stead to make, execute, acknowledge and record (a) all certificates, instruments or documents, including fictitious name or assumed name certificates, as may be required by, or may be appropriate under, the laws of any state or jurisdiction in which the Company is doing or intends to do business and (b) all agreements, documents, certificates or other instruments amending this Agreement or the Certificate of Formation that may be necessary or appropriate to reflect or accomplish (i) a change in the name or location of the principal place of business of the Company or a change of name or address of a Member, (ii) the disposal or increase by a Member of his Interest in the Company or any part thereof, (iii) a distribution and reduction of the capital contribution of a Member or any other changes in the capital of the Company, (iv) the dissolution or termination of the Company, (v) the addition or substitution of a person becoming a Member of the Company and (vi) any amendment to this Agreement, in each case only to the extent expressly authorized and conducted in accordance with the preceding sections of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.11.Severability.

SECTION 10.17.Corporate Opportunity; Fiduciary Duty.  (a) To the greatest extent permitted by law, none of Lazard Ltd, any Affiliate of Lazard Ltd (each such Affiliate of Lazard Ltd, a “Lazard Ltd Affiliate”) and none of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall owe any fiduciary duty to, nor shall any of Lazard Ltd or any Lazard Ltd Affiliate be liable for breach of fiduciary duty to, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other holder of Interests or Affiliate of such holder (or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents).  To the greatest extent permitted by law, in taking any action, making any decision or exercising any discretion with respect to the Company, each of Lazard Ltd and each Lazard Ltd Affiliate shall be entitled to consider such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests and those of other Lazard Ltd Affiliates, and shall have no duty or obligation (i) to give any consideration to the interests of or factors affecting the Company, the holders of Interests or any other person or (ii) to abstain from participating in any vote or other action of the Company or any Affiliate thereof, the Lazard Board or any committee or similar body of any of the foregoing.  Lazard Ltd and any Lazard Ltd Affiliate (and their respective officers, directors, employees or agents) shall not violate a duty or obligation to the Company merely because such person’s conduct furthers such person’s own interest.  Such persons may lend money to and transact other business with the Company.  The rights and obligations of any such person who lends money to, contracts with, borrows from or transacts business with the Company are the same as those of a person who is not involved with the Company, subject to other applicable law.  To the greatest extent permitted by law, no transaction with the Company shall be voidable solely because any such person has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction.  Nothing herein contained shall prevent any such person from conducting any other business, including serving

as an officer, director, employee, or stockholder of any corporation, a trustee of any trust, an executor or administrator of any estate, or an administrative official of any other business or not-for-profit entity, or from receiving any compensation in connection therewith.

(b)Neither the alteration, amendment, termination, expiration or repeal of this Section 10.17 nor the adoption of any provision of this Agreement inconsistent with this Section 10.17 shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Section 10.17 in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Section 10.17, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, termination, expiration, repeal or adoption.
