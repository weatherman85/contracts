The parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS

SECTION 1.01. Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings specified below:

“ABR”, when used in reference to any Loan or Borrowing, refers to whether such Loan, or the Loans comprising such Borrowing, are bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate.

“Adjusted LIBO Rate” means, with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to (a) the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period multiplied by (b) the Statutory Reserve Rate.

“Administrative Agent” means JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., together with its Affiliates, as the administrative agent for the Lenders hereunder, together with any of its successors.

“Affected Financial Institution” means (a) any EEA Financial Institution or (b) any UK Financial Institution.

“Affiliate” means, with respect to a specified Person, another Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified.

“Agents” means, collectively, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents and the Administrative Agent.

“Aggregate Exposure” means, with respect to any Lender at any time, an amount equal to (a) until the Effective Date, the amount of such Lender’s Commitments at such time and (b) thereafter, such Lender’s Commitment then in effect or, if the Commitments have been terminated, the amount of such Lender’s Loans (and, in the case of Foreign Currency Loans, the Dollar Equivalent of such Lender’s Foreign Currency Loans) then outstanding; provided that, in the case of Section 2.16, when a Defaulting Lender shall exist, any such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment shall be disregarded in the calculation.

“Aggregate Exposure Percentage” means, with respect to any Lender at any time, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of such Lender’s Aggregate Exposure at such time to the Aggregate Exposure of all Lenders at such time.

“Agreement” means this 364-Day Credit Agreement, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time.

“Alternate Base Rate” means, for any day, a rate per annum (rounded, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the highest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the New York Fed Bank Rate in effect on such day plus 1⁄2 of 1% and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for an Interest Period of one (1) month’s duration on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) plus 1%; provided that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for any day shall be based on the LIBO Screen Rate (or if the LIBO Screen Rate is not available for such one month Interest Period, the Interpolated Rate) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time on such day (without any rounding). Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate, the New York Fed Bank Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be effective from and including the effective date of such change in the Prime Rate, the New York Fed Bank Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate, respectively. If the Alternate Base Rate is being used as an alternate rate of interest pursuant to Section 2.11 (for the avoidance of doubt, only until any amendment has become effective pursuant to Section 2.11(b)), then the Alternate Base Rate shall be the greater of clauses (a) and (b) above and shall be determined without reference to clause (c) above. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Alternate Base Rate as determined pursuant to the foregoing would be less than 1.00%, such rate shall be deemed to be 1.00% for purposes of this Agreement.

“Alternative Currency” means Pounds Sterling and Euros.

“Anti-Corruption Laws” means the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the UK Bribery Act 2010, as amended.

“Bail-In Action” means the exercise of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority in respect of any liability of an Affected Financial Institution.

“Bail-In Legislation” means (a) with respect to any EEA Member Country implementing Article 55 of Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union, the implementing law, regulation rule or requirement for such EEA Member Country from time to time which is described in the EU Bail-In Legislation Schedule and (b) with respect to the United Kingdom, Part I of the United Kingdom Banking Act 2009 (as amended from time to time) and any other law, regulation or rule applicable in the United Kingdom relating to the resolution of unsound or failing banks, investment firms or other financial institutions or their affiliates (other than through liquidation, administration or other insolvency proceedings).

“Benchmark Replacement Adjustment” means the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of the LIBO Rate with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body and/or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of the LIBO Rate with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for multicurrency syndicated credit facilities at such time.

 	(2)	
if, and to the extent that, the Administrative Agent determines that Compounded SOFR cannot be determined in accordance with clause (1) above, then the rate, or methodology for this rate, and conventions for this rate that the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, determines in its reasonable discretion are substantially consistent with any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining compounded SOFR for multicurrency syndicated credit facilities at such time;

provided, further, that if the Administrative Agent decides that any such rate, methodology or convention determined in accordance with clause (1) or clause (2) is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, then Compounded SOFR will be deemed unable to be determined for purposes of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement.”

“Conduit Lender” means any special purpose corporation organized and administered by any Lender for the purpose of making Loans otherwise required to be made by such Lender and designated by such Lender in a written instrument; provided, that the designation by any Lender of a Conduit Lender shall not relieve the designating Lender of any of its obligations to fund a Loan under this Agreement if, for any reason, its Conduit Lender fails to fund any such Loan, and the designating Lender (and not the Conduit Lender) shall have the sole right and responsibility to deliver all consents and waivers required or requested under this Agreement with respect to its Conduit Lender, and provided, further, that no Conduit Lender shall (a) be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to Section 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 or 10.05 than the designating Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the extensions of credit made by such Conduit Lender, or (b) be deemed to have any Commitment.

“Consolidated EBITDA” means, for any period, Consolidated Operating Income for such period plus, without duplication and to the extent reducing such Consolidated Operating Income for such period, the sum of (a) depreciation and amortization expense, (b) amortization of intangibles (including, but not limited to, goodwill), (c) non-cash expenses or losses related to periodic mark-to-market charges related to pension losses, and (d) non-cash asset impairment charges related to long-lived assets (including intangible asset impairment charges), and minus, without duplication, to the extent included in such Consolidated Operating Income for such period, non-cash periodic mark-to-market credits related to pension gains, all as determined on a consolidated basis.

SECTION 1.06. Interest Rates; LIBOR Notification. The interest rate on a Loan denominated in dollars or an Alternative Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform.

The interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate, which is derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election, Section 2.11(b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower, pursuant to Section 2.11(d) of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of “LIBO Rate” or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 2.11(b), whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 2.11(c)), including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.

SECTION 1.07. Termination of the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement. The parties to this Agreement agree that, on the Effective Date, (i) all amounts payable under the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement by the Borrower have been paid in full, (ii) all liabilities, obligations and indebtedness owing by the Borrower to the “Lenders” (as defined in the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement) under the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement shall be released, discharged and satisfied in full, (iii) the “Commitments” (as defined in the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement) under the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement shall be terminated in full and (iv) all guarantees of the “Obligations” (as defined in the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement) under each “Loan Document” (as defined in the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement) created in connection with the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement shall be automatically terminated and released with no further action.

Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

SECTION 2.04. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make (i) each Dollar Revolving Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof in Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time and (ii) each Euro Revolving Loan or Sterling Revolving Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof in Euro or Pounds Sterling, as applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, London time, in each case, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request.

(b) Unless, prior to the proposed time of any advance of any Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, or unless the Administrative Agent has knowledge that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, at a rate equal to the greater of (x) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans; provided that, to the extent that the Borrower makes any such payment and the applicable Lender subsequently makes a corresponding payment, then the Borrower shall be entitled (without prejudice to any other rights that the Borrower may have against the applicable Lender) to receive any such payment (with interest) made by such Lender. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.

(a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section; provided that only Eurodollar Borrowings which are Dollar Revolving Loans may be converted into an ABR Borrowing. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.

(c) Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one (1) month’s duration.

(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.

(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to (i) a Eurodollar Borrowing which is a Dollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing or (ii) any other Eurodollar Borrowing, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a Eurodollar Borrowing with an Interest Period of one (1) month’s duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, (A) each Eurodollar Borrowing that is a Dollar Revolving Loan shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (B) each other Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to a Eurodollar Borrowing with an Interest Period of one (1) month’s duration.

Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

SECTION 2.07. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt; Term-Out Option. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan in the same currency as the applicable Loan on the Maturity Date; provided that, the Borrower may elect, by giving written notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Maturity Date, that the aggregate principal amount of all Loans outstanding on the Maturity Date shall be payable on the date which is the first anniversary of the Maturity Date, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.02(a) and (b) on the Maturity Date (and for the avoidance of doubt, such loans shall be “term loans”, and to extent repaid, may not be reborrowed) and the payment of the fee set forth in Section 2.09(b). The Borrower hereby further agrees to pay interest in immediately available funds at the office of the Administrative Agent on the unpaid principal amount of the Loans from time to time from the date hereof until payment in full thereof at the rates per annum, and on the dates, set forth in Section 2.10. In the event the Borrower exercises the term-out option and extends the Maturity Date, the Commitments shall terminate and the commitment fee shall cease to accrue as of the then existing Maturity Date.

(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.

(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

27

(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.06) be represented by one (1) or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

SECTION 2.08. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part without incurring a prepayment penalty, fee, or other cost (except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement), subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.

(b) If, on any Calculation Date, the total Credit Exposures (based on the Dollar Equivalent thereof, in the case of Foreign Currency Loans) exceeds 105% of the Commitments, the Borrower shall, on such day, prepay the Loans in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount of such excess and (y) the amount of such Loans.

(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, three (3) Business Days before the date of prepayment, or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, one (1) Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the Type, currency and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.06, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.06. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.    Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.10 and any amounts due under Section 2.13.

SECTION 2.09. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily undrawn amount of the Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears in Dollars on each Fee Payment Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

(b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a term-out fee in an amount equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Loans of such Lender to remain outstanding on and after the Maturity Date to the extent the Borrower elects to extend the Maturity Date in accordance with Section 2.07(a), payable on the Maturity Date (as in effect prior to such extension).

(c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

 

28

(d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

SECTION 2.10. Interest.    (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

(b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing for the relevant currency plus the Applicable Rate.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, two percent (2%) plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above, or (ii) in the case of any other amount, two percent (2%) plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided above.

(d) Accrued interest on each Loan (including Loans outstanding during the term-out period referred to in Section 2.07) shall be payable in arrears in the currency of the applicable Loan on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion, and (iv) all accrued interest shall be payable upon termination of the Commitments.

(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and (ii) interest computed by reference to the Eurodollar Rate with respect to Sterling Revolving Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days, and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.11. Alternate Rate of Interest.

(a) If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

(i) subject to clause (b) below, the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate (including because the Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), as applicable, for such Interest Period;

(ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for the applicable currency and such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for the applicable currency and such Interest Period; or

 

29

(iii) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that deposits in the applicable currency are not generally available, or cannot be obtained by the Lenders, in the applicable market (any Foreign Currency affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.11(a) or (b) is referred to as an “Affected Foreign Currency”),

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter (if such notice is given by telephone, the Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter provide written confirmation of such notice to the Borrower and the Lenders) and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing in Dollars. Until such relevant notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans in an Affected Foreign Currency shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the relevant Borrower have the right to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans (to the extent Euro such Eurodollar Loan is denominated in an Affected Foreign Currency).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the LIBO Rate with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower, so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such proposed amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders; provided that, with respect to any such proposed amendment containing any SOFR-Based Rate, the Lenders shall be entitled to object only to the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment contained therein. Any such amendment with respect to an Early Opt-in Election will become effective on the date that Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders accept such amendment. No replacement of LIBO Rate with a Benchmark Replacement will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.

(c) In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.

(d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes and (iv) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.11, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.11.

 

30

(e) Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing in Dollars.

SECTION 2.12. Increased Costs; Illegality. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate);

(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender; or

(iii) subject any Lender to any Tax (except for (1) Indemnified Taxes, (2) Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (3) Taxes imposed, as a result of a present or former connection between the Lender and the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes (other than a connection arising from such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document), on gross or net income, profits or revenue (including value-added or similar Taxes)) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or, in the case of (iii), any Loans) or of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity ratios), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c) If by reason of any change in a Requirement of Law subsequent to the Effective Date, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or similar event, the funding of any Foreign Currency Loan in any currency or the funding of any Foreign Currency Loan in any currency to an office located other than in New York shall be impossible or such currency is no longer available or readily convertible to Dollars, or the Dollar Equivalent of such currency is no longer readily calculable, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, no Foreign Currency Loans in the relevant currency shall be made or any Foreign Currency Loan in the relevant currency shall be made to an office of the Administrative Agent located in New York, as the case may be.

 

31

(d) (i) If payment in respect of any Foreign Currency Loan shall be due in a currency other than Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any change in a Requirement of Law subsequent to the Effective Date, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or similar event, payment of such Obligations in such currency or such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, such currency is no longer available or readily convertible to Dollars, or the Dollar Equivalent of such currency is no longer readily calculable, then, at the election of any affected Lender, the Borrower shall make payment of such Loan in Dollars (based upon the Exchange Rate in effect for the day on which such payment occurs, as determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof) and/or in New York or (ii) if any Foreign Currency in which Loans are outstanding is redenominated then, at the election of any affected Lender, such affected Loan and all obligations of the applicable Borrower in respect thereof shall be converted into obligations in Dollars (based upon the Exchange Rate in effect on such date, as determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof), and, in each case, the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders, against any currency exchange losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.

(e) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and the effective date of the relevant Change in Law, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof.

(f) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than three (3) months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the three (3) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

(g) If any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans, (i) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be suspended until such time as it shall no longer be unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans and (ii) such Lender’s Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Loans in Dollars on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.13.

SECTION 2.13. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of any prepayment under Section 2.08 hereof or an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.08(c) and is revoked in accordance herewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.17, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense

 

32

attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an Affiliate of such Lender) for dollar deposits from other banks in the eurodollar market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount, and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof.

SECTION 2.14. Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Loan Parties under this Agreement shall (except as required by applicable law) be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority. If any Taxes are required to be deducted or withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as determined in good faith by the applicable Withholding Agent, (i) such amounts shall be paid to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and (ii) if such deducted or withheld Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, the amounts so payable by the applicable Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, (after payment of all Indemnified Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement as if such withholding or deduction had not been made.

(b) The Loan Parties shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(c) Whenever any Indemnified Taxes are payable by the Loan Parties pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section, as promptly as possible thereafter the applicable Loan Party shall pay such Indemnified Taxes and shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt, to the extent reasonably available, received by the applicable Loan Party showing payment thereof. If (i) the applicable Loan Party fails to pay any Indemnified Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority, (ii) the applicable Loan Party fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, or (iii) any Indemnified Taxes are imposed directly upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the applicable Loan Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for such amounts and any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result (whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

 

33

(d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Taxes attributable to such Lender that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, but only to the extent that the applicable Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties under this Section 2.14 to do so, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d).

(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.14, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(f) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (or, if earlier, the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement), such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.14(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment (A) the failure to complete, execute or submit such documentation would not render the terms of this Agreement unenforceable by law and (B) such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

(A) Each Lender that is a “United States person” as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two (2) properly completed and duly signed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax.

(B) Each Lender that is not a “United States person” as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a “Non-U.S. Lender”) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent whichever of the following is applicable:

(2) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;

 

34

(3) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;

(4) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of “portfolio interest,” (x) a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of any Loan Party within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”), and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E;

(5) to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;

(C) any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable requirements of U.S. federal income tax law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements of law to permit the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.

(D) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.14(f)(ii)(D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

All forms described in this Section 2.14(f) shall be delivered by each Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. In addition, each Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Lender. Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.14(f), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section that such Lender is not legally able to deliver.

 

35

(g) The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 2.15. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or under Sections 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York (or such other address designated by the Administrative Agent to Borrower pursuant to Section 10.02) and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 10.05 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in the currencies specified hereunder.

(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.

(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the New York Fed Bank Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

 

36

(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or 2.15(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

SECTION 2.16. Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent shall deliver written notice to such effect, upon the Administrative Agent’s obtaining knowledge of such event, to the Borrower and such Defaulting Lender, and the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:

(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the undrawn portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.09(a).

(b) the Commitment and Aggregate Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 10.01), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which would increase or extend the term of the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender, extend the date fixed for payment of principal or interest owing to a Defaulting Lender, reduce the amount of or the rate or amount of interest on any amount owing to a Defaulting Lender or of any fee payable to a Defaulting Lender (except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.16) or alter the terms and conditions of this sentence or affect such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall, in each case, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.

(c) any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise and including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.15(c) but excluding Section 2.17(b)) shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent, and (iii) third, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(d) [reserved].

(e) [reserved].

In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender or upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of the confirmation referred to in clause (c) of the definition of “Defaulting Lender”, as applicable, then on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such portion of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans ratably in accordance with its respective Commitment.

 

37

SECTION 2.17. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.12 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed costs or expenses and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment would avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Loans under Section 2.11, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

(b) The Borrower shall, at its sole expense and effort, have the right, by giving at least fifteen (15) Business Days’ prior written notice (or, in the case of a Defaulting Lender, at least three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice) to the affected Lender and the Administrative Agent, at any time when no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to require any Lender to assign all of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to one (1) or more Lenders (other than any Conduit Lender), or, with the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval will not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned), to one (1) or more banks, financial institutions or other entities selected by the Borrower. Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto but, except in the case of an assignment by a Defaulting Lender (in which case such form shall be as reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent) shall be on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the affected Lender; provided that, no such assignment shall, unless otherwise specified, transfer any liability of a Defaulting Lender hereunder or release any such liability. The Borrower shall remain liable to the affected Lender for any indemnification provided under Section 2.13 with respect to Loans of such Lender outstanding on the effective date of an assignment required under this Section 2.17(b), as well as for all other Obligations owed to such Lender under this Agreement as of such effective date.

ARTICLE IX

THE AGENTS

SECTION 9.01. Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations, or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 9.02. Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

SECTION 9.03. Exculpatory Provisions. Neither any Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact, or Affiliates shall be (i) liable to any Lender for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations, or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement, or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party that is a party thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the Properties, books or records of any Loan Party.

SECTION 9.04. Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex, or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The

 

51

Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

SECTION 9.05. Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

SECTION 9.06. Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact, or Affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any Affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, Property, financial, and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their Affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, Property, financial, and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their Affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, Property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact, or Affiliates.

SECTION 9.07. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 9.07 (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no

 

52

Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements that are found by a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 9.07 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. The respective obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement are several and not joint, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to satisfy its obligations hereunder.

SECTION 9.08. Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.

SECTION 9.09. Successor Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon ten (10) days’ notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under paragraph (a) of Article VIII or paragraph (i) of Article VIII with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers, and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term “Administrative Agent” shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent’s rights, powers, and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is thirty (30) days following a retiring Administrative Agent’s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article IX shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

(b) The Administrative Agent agrees that in the event it shall fail to fund its portion of any Borrowing within three (3) Business Days of the date on which it shall have been required to fund same, it shall cooperate in good faith with efforts by the Borrower to replace it with a successor administrative agent that is satisfactory to the Required Lenders and the Borrower (including resigning in connection with such replacement).

SECTION 9.10. Documentation Agents and Syndication Agent. None of the Documentation or the Syndication Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such.

SECTION 9.11. Certain ERISA Matters.

(a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, that at least one of the following is and will be true:

 

53

(i) such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments, or this Agreement,

(iii) (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, or

(iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Lender.

(b) In addition, unless sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or such Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).

SECTION 10.03. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent, Borrower, or any Lender, any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers, and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers, and privileges provided by law.

SECTION 10.04. Survival of Representations and Warranties.

The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent as separately agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, and filing and recording fees and expenses, with statements with respect to the foregoing to be submitted to the Borrower prior to the Effective Date (in the case of amounts to be paid on the Effective Date) and from time to time thereafter on a quarterly basis or such other periodic basis as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate, (b) to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to each Lender and of counsel to the Administrative Agent, (c) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect to stamp, excise, and other taxes, if any, that are payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement, or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, and (d) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the Administrative Agent and their respective officers, directors, employees, affiliates, and agents (each, an “Indemnitee”) harmless from and against any and all other liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance, and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including any of the foregoing relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or the violation of, noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to the operations of the Borrower, any Guarantor or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, any Environmental Liability, and the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel actually incurred in connection with claims, actions or proceedings by any Indemnitee against any Loan Party under any Loan Document (all the foregoing in this paragraph (d), collectively, the “Indemnified Liabilities”), provided, that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are found by a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive, all rights for contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs, and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee. All amounts due under this Section 10.05 shall be payable not later than thirty (30) days after written demand therefor, which shall set forth in reasonable detail the nature, basis and description of such Indemnified Liability. Statements payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 10.05 shall be submitted to FedEx

 

57

Corporation, Attn: Treasurer, at the address of the Borrower set forth in Section 10.02, or to such other Person or address as may be hereafter designated by the Borrower in a written notice to the Administrative Agent. The agreements in this Section 10.05 shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 10.06. Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, all future holders of the Loans and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each Lender.

(b) Any Lender other than any Conduit Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one (1) or more banks, financial institutions or other entities (each, a “Participant”) participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Loan for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In no event shall any Participant under any such participation have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees payable hereunder, or postpone the date of the final maturity of the Loans, in each case to the extent subject to such participation. The Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement and the Loans are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement, provided that, in purchasing such participating interest, such Participant shall be deemed to have agreed to share with the Lenders the proceeds thereof as provided in Section 10.07(a) as fully as if it were a Lender hereunder. The Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 with respect to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time as if it were a Lender; provided that, in the case of Sections 2.13 and 2.14, such Participant shall have complied with the requirements of said Sections as if it were a Lender (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.14(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender); and provided, further, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to any such Section than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer occurred, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (but without giving rise to any fiduciary obligation of any kind to the Borrower), maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided, however, that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment,

 

58

Loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c ) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

(c) Any Lender other than any Conduit Lender (an “Assignor”) may, in accordance with applicable law, at any time and from time to time assign to any Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender) or any Lender Affiliate or, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (which, in each case, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to an additional bank, financial institution or other entity (an “Assignee”) all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, executed by such Assignee, such Assignor and any other Person whose consent is required pursuant to this paragraph, and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register (as defined below); provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, no such assignment to an Assignee (other than any Lender or any Lender Affiliate) shall be in an aggregate principal amount of less than $5,000,000 and after giving effect to such assignment, such assigning Lender shall have Commitments and Loans in an aggregate amount of at least $5,000,000 as described in this sentence except in the case of an assignment of all of a Lender’s interests under this Agreement. For purposes of the proviso contained in the preceding sentence, the amount described therein shall be aggregated in respect of each Lender and its Lender Affiliates, if any. The Assignee shall purchase, at par, all Loans and pay all accrued interest and other amounts owing to such Assignor under this Agreement on or prior to the date of assignment for any assignment pursuant to Section 2.17. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder with a Commitment and/or Loans as set forth therein, and (y) the Assignor thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.13, 2.14, and 10.05 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior to the effective date of such assignment) and be released from its obligations (other than its obligations under Section 9.07 with respect to matters arising prior to the effective date of such assignment) under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of an Assignor’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Assignor shall cease to be a party hereto). Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 10.06, (i) the consent of the Borrower shall not be required for any assignment that occurs after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and (ii) no assignment shall be made to the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign at any time to its designating Lender hereunder without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder and pursuant to its designation agreement and without regard to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.06(c).

(d) The Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the Borrower, maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the “Register”) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and the principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, each other Loan Party, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loans and any Notes evidencing the Loans recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. Any assignment of any Loan, whether or not evidenced by a Note, shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register (and each Note shall expressly so provide). Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a Note shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance, and thereupon one or more new Notes shall be issued to the designated Assignee.

 

59

(e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an Assignor, an Assignee and any other Person whose consent is required by Section 10.06(c), together with payment to the Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $4,000, the Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register on the effective date determined pursuant thereto, and (iii) promptly notify Borrower of its receipt of such Assignment and Acceptance.

(f) For avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 10.06 concerning assignments relate only to absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including any pledge or assignment by a Lender to any Federal Reserve Bank or central bank in accordance with applicable law.

(g) The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (f) above.

(h) Each of the Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one (1) year and one (1) day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party to this Agreement for any loss, cost, damage, or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance.

SECTION 10.07. Adjustments; Set-off. (a) Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders, if any Lender (a “Benefitted Lender”) shall, at any time after the Loans and other amounts payable hereunder shall immediately become due and payable pursuant to Article VIII, receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in paragraph (i) of Article VIII, or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other Lender, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

(b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders and the Lender Affiliates provided by law, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and Lender Affiliate shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise), to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured, or unmatured, at any

 

60

time held or owing by such Lender or Lender Affiliate or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower, as the case may be. Each Lender and Lender Affiliate agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender or Lender Affiliate, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

SECTION 10.08. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one (1) or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one (1) and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 10.09. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 10.10. Integration. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any commitment letters or similar documents related to the Transactions, represent the entire agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations, or warranties by the Borrower, Administrative Agent, or any Lender relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 10.11. GOVERNING LAW.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

(b) Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, notwithstanding the governing law provisions of any applicable Loan Document, any claims brought against the Administrative Agent by any Lender relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or the consummation or administration of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

SECTION 10.12. Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers.

The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:

(a) submits for itself and its Property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan (or if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York City, Borough of Manhattan), and appellate courts from any thereof;

 

61

(b) consents that any such action or proceeding shall be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

(c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the Borrower at its address set forth in Section 10.02 or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto;

(d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

(e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages.

SECTION 10.13. Acknowledgements. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that:

(a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution, and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;

(b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor;

(c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders; and

(d) the Loan Parties have been advised that the Administrative Agent and Lenders are engaged in a broad range of transactions that may involve interests that differ from the Loan Parties’ interests and that the Administrative Agent and Lenders have no obligation to disclose such interests and transactions to the Loan Parties.

SECTION 10.14. Guarantors. (a) The Guarantors as of the date hereof are set forth on Schedule 10.14 hereto.

(b) Upon any Subsidiary guaranteeing any public debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Borrower or any other Material Indebtedness of the Borrower, within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Borrower shall cause such Subsidiary to execute the Guarantee Agreement pursuant to an Addendum thereto in the form of Annex I to the Guarantee Agreement, and in the case of a Significant Subsidiary, to deliver documentation, to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, similar to that described in Section 5.01(c) and (d) relating to the authorization for, execution and delivery of, and validity of such Significant Subsidiary’s obligations as a Guarantor, such documentation to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

 

62

(c) The Borrower covenants and agrees with the Lenders that each Specified Guarantor is, and shall remain, an entity organized under the laws of any jurisdiction within the United States. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.14(c) shall not prohibit any merger or consolidation of a Specified Guarantor; provided, that, in accordance with the definition of “Specified Guarantor”, any Person into which such Specified Guarantor is merged or consolidated, or to which all or substantially all of its assets are sold, transferred or disposed, shall become a Specified Guarantor and be subject to the provisions of this Section 10.14(c).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the release of any Guarantor (other than any Specified Guarantor) from its guarantee of any and all public debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Borrower, such Guarantor shall be deemed to be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement without any further action required on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender. At the request and sole expense of the Borrower following any such release and discharge, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to the Borrower such documents as the Borrower shall reasonably request to evidence such release and discharge. For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed and understood that any release of any Specified Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement shall be subject to Section 10.01.

SECTION 10.15. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees to keep confidential all non-public information provided to its or its Affiliates by any Loan Party or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent or any Lender from disclosing any such information (a) to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (b) subject to an agreement by such Person to comply with the provisions of this Section, to any actual or prospective Transferee or any actual or prospective direct or indirect counterparty to any Hedge Agreement (or any professional advisor to such counterparty), (c) to its employees or directors, or those of its Affiliates, agents, attorneys, accountants, and other professional advisors, or any Lender Affiliates, who are made aware of the confidential requirements of this Section 10.15 and who are instructed to keep such information confidential in accordance therewith, (d) upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority, (e) in response to any order of any court or other Governmental Authority or as may otherwise be required pursuant to any Requirement of Law, (f) if required to do so in connection with any litigation or similar proceeding, (g) that has been publicly disclosed, (h) to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender’s investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect to such Lender, (i) in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document or (j) with the written consent of the Borrower. The provisions of this Section 10.15 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of one (1) year.

SECTION 10.16. WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

SECTION 10.17. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received, or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

 

63

SECTION 10.18. Headings. The section and other headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.19. USA Patriot Act; Beneficial Ownership Regulation.

(a) Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Act”), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower and its subsidiaries, which information includes the name and business address of the Borrower, its subsidiaries and other required information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower and its subsidiaries in accordance with the Act, such as tax identification numbers and legal organizational documents. The Borrower and its subsidiaries shall promptly provide such information upon request by any Lender.

(a) Promptly following any request therefor, the Borrower shall provide information and documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for purposes of compliance with the Beneficial Ownership Regulation.

In connection therewith, each Lender hereby agrees that such information shall be covered by the confidentiality provisions set forth in Section 10.15 hereof.

SECTION 10.20. Judgment Currency.

(a) The Loan Parties’ obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to make payments in Dollars shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency other than Dollars, except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the Administrative Agent, the respective Lender of the full amount of Dollars expressed to be payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any Loan Party in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other than Dollars (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the “Judgment Currency”) an amount due in Dollars, the conversion shall be made at the Dollar Equivalent determined as of the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the “Judgment Currency Conversion Date”).

(b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the amount due, the Loan Parties shall pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts, if any (but in any event not a lesser amount) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of Dollars which could have been purchased with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion Date.

(c) For purposes of determining the Dollar Equivalent or any other rate of exchange for this Section 10.20, such amounts shall include any premium and costs payable in connection with the purchase of Dollars.

 

64

SECTION 10.21. Waiver. Each Lender party hereto which is also party to the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement hereby waives compliance by the Borrower with the requirement of three (3) Business Days’ (as defined therein) notice thereunder for the termination of the Commitments (as defined therein) pursuant to Section 2.06(b) thereto.

SECTION 10.22. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and

(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:

(i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;

(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or

(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.
