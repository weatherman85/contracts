This SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED GUARANTY, dated as of  October 10, 2023 (as may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this “Guaranty”), is made by PENNYMAC MORTGAGE INVESTMENT TRUST (“Guarantor”), in favor of, and consented and agreed to by, the buyers from time to time party to the VF1 Repurchase Agreement (as defined herein) (each a “Buyer”, and collectively, the “Buyers”).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Guarantor has entered into that certain Amended and Restated Guaranty, dated as of June 29, 2018 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Original Guaranty”), in favor of Nexera Holding LLC (“Nexera”) and Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), as Buyers;

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 13 of the Original Guaranty, the Original Guaranty may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified by a written instrument executed by Guarantor and Buyers;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement, dated as of October 10, 2023 (as may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “VF1 Repurchase Agreement”), among PennyMac Corp., as a seller (“PMC Seller”), PennyMac Holdings LLC, as a seller (“PMH Seller” and, together with PMC Seller, the “Sellers”), the buyers from time to time party thereto and Atlas Securitized Products, L.P., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), the Buyers have agreed from time to time to enter into Transactions with Sellers;

WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the obligation of the Buyers to enter into Transactions with Sellers under the VF1 Repurchase Agreement that Guarantor shall have executed and delivered this Guaranty to the Buyers;

WHEREAS, as a condition precedent to entering into the VF1 Repurchase Agreement, the Guarantor is required to execute and deliver this Guaranty;

WHEREAS, the Guarantor will receive a benefit, either directly or indirectly from the Sellers for entering into this Guaranty; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, to induce the Buyers to enter into the VF1 Repurchase Agreement and to enter into Transactions thereunder, Guarantor hereby agrees with the Buyers, as follows:

1.	Defined Terms.  (a) Unless otherwise defined herein, terms which are defined in the VF1 Repurchase Agreement and used herein are so used as so defined.

(b)	For purposes of this Guaranty, “Obligations” shall mean all obligations and liabilities of Sellers to the Buyers, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to become due, or now existing or hereafter incurred, which may arise under, or out of or in 

1

 

connection with the VF1 Repurchase Agreement and any other Program Agreements and any other document made, delivered or given in connection therewith or herewith, whether on account of principal, interest, reimbursement obligations, fees, indemnities, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and disbursements of counsel to Buyers that are required to be paid by Sellers pursuant to the terms of the Program Agreements and costs of enforcement of this Guaranty reasonably incurred) or otherwise.

2.	Guaranty.  (a) Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Buyers the prompt and complete payment and performance by Sellers when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations.

(b)	Guarantor further agrees to pay any and all expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and disbursements of counsel) which may be paid or incurred by the Buyers in enforcing, or obtaining advice of counsel in respect of, any rights with respect to, or collecting, any or all of the Obligations and/or enforcing any rights with respect to, or collecting against, Guarantor under this Guaranty.  This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect until the later of (i) the termination of the VF1 Repurchase Agreement and (ii) the Obligations are paid in full, notwithstanding that from time to time prior thereto Sellers may be free from any Obligations.

(c)	No payment or payments made by Sellers or any other Person or received or collected by the Buyers from Sellers or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application, at any time or from time to time, in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of Guarantor hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments, remain liable for the amount of the outstanding Obligations until the outstanding Obligations are paid in full.

(d)	Guarantor agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, Guarantor shall make any payment to the Buyers on account of Guarantor’s liability hereunder, Guarantor will notify the Buyers in writing that such payment is made under this Guaranty for such purpose.

3.	Right of Set-off.  The Buyers are hereby irrevocably authorized at any time and from time to time without notice to Guarantor, any such notice being hereby waived by Guarantor, to set-off and appropriate and apply any and all monies and other property of Guarantor, deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by the Buyers or any Affiliate thereof to or for the credit or the account of Guarantor, or any part thereof in such amounts as the Buyers may elect, on account of the Obligations and liabilities of Guarantor hereunder and claims of every nature and description of the Buyers against Guarantor, in any currency, whether arising hereunder, under the VF1 Repurchase Agreement or otherwise, as the Buyers may elect, whether or not the Buyers have made any demand for payment and although such Obligations and liabilities and claims may be contingent or unmatured.  The Buyers shall notify Guarantor promptly of any such set-off and the application made by the Buyers, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.  The rights of the Buyers under this 

2

 

paragraph are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which the Buyers may have.

4.	Subrogation.  Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by Guarantor hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of Guarantor by the Buyers, Guarantor shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Buyers against Sellers or any other guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by Buyer for the payment of the Obligations, nor shall Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from Sellers or any other guarantor in respect of payments made by Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Buyers by Sellers on account of the Obligations are paid in full and the VF1 Repurchase Agreement is terminated.  If any amount shall be paid to Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amounts shall be held by Guarantor for the benefit of the Buyers, segregated from other funds of Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by Guarantor, be turned over to the Buyers in the exact form received by Guarantor (duly indorsed by Guarantor to the Buyers, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as Buyers may determine.

5.	Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Obligations.  Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against Guarantor, and without notice to or further assent by Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Buyers may be rescinded by the Buyers, and any of the Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Buyers, and the VF1 Repurchase Agreement, and the other Program Agreements and any other document in connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, pursuant to its terms and as  the Buyers may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by  the Buyers for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. The Buyers shall have no obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for this Guaranty or any property subject thereto.  When making any demand hereunder against Guarantor, the Buyers may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on Sellers and any failure by Buyers to make any such demand or to collect any payments from Sellers or any release of Sellers shall not relieve Guarantor of its obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of Buyer against Guarantor.  For the purposes hereof “demand” shall include, but is not limited to, the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.

6.	Guaranty Absolute and Unconditional.  (a) Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by Buyers upon this Guaranty or acceptance of this Guaranty; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived in reliance upon this Guaranty; and all dealings between  Sellers or Guarantor, on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guaranty.  Guarantor waives 

3

 

diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon Sellers or the Guaranty with respect to the Obligations. This Guaranty shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (i) the validity or enforceability of the VF1 Repurchase Agreement, the other Program Agreements, any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by Buyers, (ii) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by Sellers against Buyers, or (iii) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of Sellers or Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of Sellers for the Obligations, or of Guarantor under this Guaranty, in bankruptcy or in any other instance.  When pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against Guarantor, Buyer may, but shall be under no obligation, to pursue such rights and remedies that they may have against Sellers or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by Buyers to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from Sellers or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of Sellers or any such other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of Buyers against Guarantor.  This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon Guarantor and their successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of Buyers, and successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, until all the Obligations and the obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall have been satisfied by payment in full, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of the VF1 Repurchase Agreement Sellers may be free from any Obligations.

(b)	Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Guarantor hereby agrees, acknowledges, and represents and warrants to Buyers as follows:

(i)	Guarantor hereby waives any defense arising by reason of, and any and all right to assert against Buyers any claim or defense based upon, an election of remedies by Buyers which in any manner impairs, affects, reduces, releases, destroys and/or extinguishes Guarantor’s (x) subrogation rights, (y) rights to proceed against Sellers or any other guarantor for reimbursement or contribution, and/or (z) any other rights of Guarantor to proceed against Sellers, against any other guarantor, or against any other person or security.

(ii)	Guarantor is presently informed of the financial condition of Sellers and of all other circumstances which diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations.  Guarantor hereby covenants that it will make its own investigation and will continue to keep itself informed of each Seller’s financial condition, the status of other guarantors, if any, of all other circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment and that it will continue to rely upon sources other than Buyers for such information and will not rely upon Buyers for any such information.  Absent a written request for such information by Guarantor to Buyers, Guarantor hereby waives its right, if any, to require Buyers to disclose to Guarantor any information which Buyers may now or 

4

 

hereafter acquire concerning such condition or circumstances including, but not limited to, the release of or revocation by any other guarantor.

(iii)	Guarantor has independently reviewed the VF1 Repurchase Agreement and related agreements and has made an independent determination as to the validity and enforceability thereof, and in executing and delivering this Guaranty to Buyers, Guarantor is not in any manner relying upon the validity, and/or enforceability, and/or attachment, and/or perfection of any Liens or security interests of any kind or nature granted by Sellers or any other guarantor to Buyers, now or at any time and from time to time in the future.

(iv)	Guarantor is not required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time. 

(c) 	Guarantor hereby covenants that it shall not merge, consolidate, amalgamate, liquidate, wind up or dissolve itself (or suffer any liquidation, winding up or dissolution) or sell all or substantially all of its assets; provided that Guarantor may merge or consolidate with (i) any wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor, (ii) any other Person if Guarantor is the surviving entity; or (iii) with the prior written consent of the Buyers and the Administrative Agent, so long that, in each case, after giving effect thereto, no Default would exist hereunder.

7.	Reinstatement.  This Guaranty shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by a Buyer upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of either Seller or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, either Seller or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

8.	Payments.  Guarantor hereby agrees that the Obligations will be paid to Buyer without set-off or counterclaim in U.S. Dollars.

9.	Event of Default.  If an Event of Default under the VF1 Repurchase Agreement shall have occurred and be continuing, Guarantor agrees that, as between Guarantor and the Buyers, the Obligations may be declared to be due in accordance with the terms of the VF1 Repurchase Agreement for purposes of this Guaranty notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition which may prevent, delay or vitiate any such declaration as against the Sellers and that, in the event of any such declaration (or attempted declaration), such Obligations shall forthwith become due by Guarantor for purposes of this Guaranty.

10.	Severability.  Any provision of this Guaranty which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

11.	Headings.  The paragraph headings used in this Guaranty are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.

12.	No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  Buyers shall not by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 13 hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default or in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof.  No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of Buyers, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.  No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  A waiver by Buyers of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which Buyers would otherwise have on any future occasion.  The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

13.	Waivers and Amendments; Successors and Assigns; Governing Law.  None of the terms or provisions of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written instrument executed by Guarantor and Buyers, provided that any provision of this Guaranty may be waived by Buyers in a letter or agreement executed by Buyers or by facsimile or electronic transmission from Buyers to the Guarantor.  This Guaranty shall be binding upon the personal representatives, successors and assigns of Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of Buyers and their successors and assigns.
