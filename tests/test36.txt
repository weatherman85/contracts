EXHIBIT 10.5

Less
e)
Cash deposit and investment (Codes 50 and 51/53);

f)
Cash and cash equivalents (codes 54/58);

g)
The cash-like items, reported in the Closing Accounts, as agreed between the Parties:

i.
Accrued interests - Any accrued interest (receivable - if any) on cash and cash equivalent, as considered above, and as reported under statutory accounts #490/491. At legal entity level, these are usually reported under the following local accounts:
•
Asco Industries NV: account #414001, #414012 and #414300

Altogether, the above items are referred to as the Cash-Like Adjustments
In addition to the above, the Parties have agreed to consider the following elements as debt- and/or cash-like at Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, these elements are the result of a negotiation and are not accounted for in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year 2017.
Each of the above items or elements shall be calculated in accordance with Belgian GAAP, applied consistently in accordance with prior years.
h)
Elements of negotiation between Parties:

i.
Employee related liabilities - The Purchaser is of the opinion, on the basis of its own analysis, that some employee related liabilities that are not accounted for in the Group Companies balance sheet, should have been accounted for in accordance with US GAAP, such as: seniority days in Belgium, additional German pension plan, German jubilee plan, Belgian jubilee plan and Belgian pension plan. The Purchaser and the Sellers have negotiated a lump-sum amount of EUR 6,500,000 (six million five hundred thousand euros) to cover these. If, in accordance with Belgian GAAP, the Belgian pension plan liability would exceed EUR 400,000 (four hundred thousand euros), the excess of liability would be added to this lump sum amount for purposes of calculating the Net Debt. For the avoidance of doubt, this adjustment results in a negative adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price (i.e., debt-like component).

ii.
Value of the Existing Operational Hedges - The Parties have agreed to consider 50% of the Value of the Existing Operational Hedges as a price adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, and given the uncertainty


EXHIBIT 10.5

about the evolution of the foreign exchange rate, this element will impact on the Initial Purchase Price as follows:
•
Any upward adjustment in case the Value of the Existing Operational Hedges would be positive (i.e., cash-like);
•
Any downward adjustment in case the Value of the Existing Operational Hedges would be negative (i.e., debt-like).

iii.
Break up fee - The parties have agreed that at or immediately following Closing, the Purchaser is entitled to repay outstanding indebtedness of the Group towards financial institutions and any outstanding financial instruments listed in Schedule 5, and that make-whole amounts incurred in connection with such repayment will be treated as a debt-like component up to a maximum amount of EUR 3,304,400 (three million three hundred four thousand four hundred euros), to be decreased by the related tax effect. For the avoidance of doubt, this adjustment results in a negative adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price.

Altogether, the above items are referred to as the Negotiated Adjustments
For illustrative purposes, the calculation of Net Debt based on the consolidated and audited annual accounts of the Company for the financial year ending on 31 December 2017 is included in Schedule 6;
Net Working Capital the sum of the following elements from the consolidated and audited annual accounts of the Company for the accounting period ending at Closing:

Initial Purchase Price

The initial purchase price for the Shares amounts to USD 650,000,000 (six hundred and fifty million US dollar), reflecting the Agreed Enterprise Value on a fully consolidated basis (the “Initial Purchase Price”).
3.3
Price Adjustment

a.
The Initial Purchase Price will be adjusted based on the Closing Accounts, as follows (the “Price Adjustment”):

•
the Initial Purchase Price will be decreased by an amount equal to the Net Debt, converted into USD at the Guaranteed Exchange Rate;

•
If the amount of Net Working Capital as at Closing exceeds the Net Working Capital Ceiling, the Initial Purchase Price will be increased by an amount equal to such excess, converted into USD at the Guaranteed Exchange Rate; and

•
If the amount of Net Working Capital as at Closing is lower than the Net Working Capital Floor, the Initial Purchase Price will be decreased by an amount equal to such shortfall, converted into USD at the Guaranteed Exchange Rate;

provided that the Initial Purchase Price shall be preliminarily adjusted on the Closing Date based on the pre-Closing best estimate of the Sellers of the Closing Accounts using the best estimates of balance sheet amounts using the most recently available balance sheet prior to the Closing Date (including for the avoidance of doubt the year-end adjustments that would be included if the Closing Date were a fiscal year-end) as a starting point for the analysis (the “Best Estimate”), acting reasonably, of the amounts set forth in Clause 3.3.1 and will be further adjusted post-Closing based on the amounts set forth in Clause 3.3.1 as at the Closing Date in accordance with Clause 3.3.2 based on the Closing Accounts with respect to such amounts. The Sellers will provide a draft of the Best Estimate five (5) Business Days prior to Closing and take into consideration


EXHIBIT 10.5

all reasonable comments of the Purchaser prior to Closing. All underlying calculations shall be made in EUR; the resulting adjustments to Net Debt or Net Working Capital, if any, shall be expressed in USD using the Guaranteed Exchange Rate.
Both the Best Estimate and any amounts payable further to Clause 3.3.4 shall be payable to the Sellers in Euro and the USD amounts determined further to this Clause 3 shall for such purposes be converted into EUR at the Guaranteed Exchange Rate, save for the Deferred Capex Amount, the Holdback Amount and the Escrow Amount which will be paid to the Escrow Agent in USD.
b.
Within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause to be prepared an audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the year-end adjustments that would be included if the Closing Date were a fiscal year-end) as at Closing (without taking into account any circumstances resulting solely from the transactions contemplated hereby other than costs incurred as result of paying off the outstanding indebtedness of the Group and any outstanding financial instruments, listed in Schedule 5, up to a maximum amount of EUR 3,304,400 (three million three hundred four thousand four hundred euros), to be decreased by the related tax effect) and a statement calculating the adjustments referred to in Clause 3.3.1, prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP, applied consistently in accordance with prior years (provided that if the application in prior periods is not reconcilable with Belgian GAAP, then Belgian GAAP takes precedence) (collectively, the “Closing Accounts”). All underlying calculations shall be made in EUR; the resulting adjustments to Net Debt or Net Working Capital, if any, shall be expressed in USD using the Guaranteed Exchange Rate. The Purchaser shall provide details of any variance between the calculation of the Price Adjustment and the Final Purchase Price resulting therefrom based on the Closing Accounts and the Best Estimate. The Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Sellers’ Representative (for and on behalf of the Sellers) the Closing Accounts and the statement comprising the details of any variance between the Best Estimate and the calculation of the Price Adjustment and the Final Purchase Price resulting therefrom based on the Closing Accounts within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall, subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings being entered into, provide the Sellers’ Representative (and its advisors) reasonable access to all relevant documents, books, records and working papers used in preparation of the Closing Accounts or useful for verifying the Closing Accounts and the calculation of the Price Adjustment and the Final Purchase Price resulting therefrom, to the extent reasonably required for such review and will and shall cause the internal accounting personnel of the Group Companies to fully cooperate with and assist the Sellers’ Representative (and its advisors) with its review.

c.
The Sellers’ Representative shall have thirty (30) Business Days from the date it receives the Closing Accounts to review the Closing Accounts, and to inform the Purchaser in writing of its disagreement (an “Objection”) with the Closing Accounts or the calculation of the Price Adjustment and the Final Purchase Price resulting therefrom based on the Closing Accounts, if any. If the Sellers’ Representative raises no Objection within such thirty (30) Business Day period, the Closing Accounts shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Sellers’ Representative (for and on behalf of the Sellers) and shall become binding upon the Sellers and the Purchaser. If the Sellers’ Representative delivers an Objection to the Purchaser within such thirty (30) Business Day period, the Purchaser and the Sellers’ Representative, for and on behalf of the Sellers, shall then attempt in good faith to resolve their disagreement(s) within thirty (30) Business Days from the time the Objection is received (the “Resolution Period”). If the Sellers’ Representative, for and on behalf of the Sellers, and the Purchaser are unable to resolve their disagreement(s) with respect to the Closing Accounts within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Auditor in accordance with Clause 3.4.

d.
If the Closing Amount paid by the Purchaser to the Sellers at Closing is higher than the Final Adjusted Closing Amount, then the difference, converted into USD at the Guaranteed Exchange Rate, shall be paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser through a distribution to the Purchaser by the Escrow Agent to the extent possible out of the Holdback Amount (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, from the Escrow Amount or the Deferred Capex Amount) promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Final Purchase Price as contemplated hereunder and from the Sellers, if the Holdback Amount is insufficient. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall take all actions and execute and deliver all documents to the Escrow Agent reasonably required pursuant to the Holdback Agreement to effect any release from the Holdback Account pursuant to the preceding sentence. If the Closing Amount paid by the Purchaser to the Sellers at Closing is lower than the Final Adjusted Closing Amount, then the difference shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Sellers promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Final Purchase Price as contemplated hereunder.

e.
If all or any portion of the Holdback Amount is not distributed to the Purchaser by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Clause 3.3.4 (whether because the Final Adjusted Closing Amount exceeded the Closing Amount or because the Closing Amount exceeded the Final Adjusted Closing Amount by an amount less than the Holdback Amount), then the Sellers and the Purchaser shall take all actions and execute and deliver all documents to the Escrow Agent reasonably required pursuant to the Holdback Agreement to effect the distribution by the Escrow Agent of the remainder of the Holdback Amount from


EXHIBIT 10.5

the Holdback Account to the Escrow Account and such funds shall thereafter be included in the Escrow Amount and shall be available for the satisfaction of Claims pursuant to Clause 8, subject to the limitations of Clause 9.

3.4
Independent Auditor

a.
If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement as set forth in Clause 3.3.3 or Clause 3.5.5, the matters of contention shall be settled by an independent audit firm of good international repute not being the statutory auditor of the Company or any of the Group Companies, the Sellers, the Purchaser or of any of their Affiliates and which has not provided services to any of these persons over the three (3) years preceding the Closing Date, as the Sellers and the Purchaser shall agree or, failing agreement, appointed by the Chairman of the “Institut des réviseurs d’entreprises” / “Instituut der bedrijfsrevisoren” (the “Independent Auditor”). In doing so, the Independent Auditor shall perform a mission within the meaning of section 1592 of the Belgian Civil Code. The Independent Auditor shall be requested to make its decision on the matters in dispute (excluding any other items) within twenty (20) Business Days of confirmation and acknowledgement by the Independent Auditor of its appointment.

b.
The Independent Auditor shall act on the following basis:

•
the Independent Auditor shall determine the procedure to be followed in deciding the matter, it being understood that it shall allow the Parties to make written statements on the disputed matter;

•
the Seller and the Purchaser shall each provide (and to the extent they are reasonably able to do so, shall procure that their respective accountants, employees or advisors provide) the Independent Auditor promptly with all information which it reasonably requires and the Independent Auditor shall be entitled (to the extent considered appropriate by it) to base its opinion on such information and on the accounting and other records of the Company;

•
in connection with an engagement pursuant to Clause 3.3.3, the Independent Auditor shall determine values of Net Debt and Net Working Capital within the range presented by the Parties, applying the definitions of Net Debt and Net Working Capital as set out in this Agreement and calculated in accordance with Schedule 6 and Schedule 7 respectively;

•
in connection with an engagement pursuant to Clause 3.5.5, the Independent Auditor shall determine the value of 2020 Revenue, 2021 Revenue or 2022 Revenue, as relevant, within the range presented by the Parties, applying the definition of Annual Revenue as set out in this Agreement; and

•
the decision of the Independent Auditor shall (in the absence of manifest error or manifest breach of the principles set out in this Agreement) be final and binding upon the Parties.

c.
In connection with an engagement pursuant to Clause 3.3.3, the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne by the Parties in the same proportion as the aggregate amount of the disputed matters submitted to the Independent Auditor bears to the matters successfully disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Independent Auditor) or in such other proportions as the Independent Auditor shall determine. In connection with an engagement pursuant to Clause 3.5.5, the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne by the Sellers, unless the Independent Auditor determines the respective amount should have been released to the Sellers because the respective Revenue had not been correctly determined.

3.5
Deferred Capex Escrow

a.
If Annual Revenue for calendar year 2020 (“2020 Revenue”) equals or exceeds 2020 Target Annual Revenue, USD 7,000,000 (USD seven million) will be released from the Deferred Capex Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers pursuant to the Deferred Capex Escrow Agreement no later than February 28, 2021, and if 2020 Revenue does not equal or exceed 2020 Target Revenue, then USD 7,000,000 (USD seven million) will be released from the Deferred Capex Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent to the Purchaser pursuant to the Deferred Capex Escrow Agreement no later than February 28, 2021.

b.
If Annual Revenue for calendar year 2021 (“2021 Revenue”) equals or exceeds 2021 Target Annual Revenue, USD 7,000,000 (USD seven million) will be released from the Deferred Capex Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers pursuant to the Deferred Capex Escrow Agreement no later than February 28, 2022, and if 2021 Revenue does not equal or exceed 2021 Target Revenue, then USD 7,000,000 (USD seven million) will be released from the Deferred Capex Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent to the Purchaser pursuant to the Deferred Capex Escrow Agreement no later than February 28, 2022.


EXHIBIT 10.5

c.
If Annual Revenue for calendar year 2022 (“2022 Revenue”) equals or exceeds 2022 Target Annual Revenue, USD 6,000,000 (USD six million) will be released from the Deferred Capex Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers pursuant to the Deferred Capex Escrow Agreement no later than February 28, 2023, and if 2022 Revenue does not equal or exceed 2022 Target Revenue, then USD 6,000,000 (USD six million) will be released from the Deferred Capex Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent to the Purchaser pursuant to the Deferred Capex Escrow Agreement no later than February 28, 2023.

d.
During the period from the Closing Date through December 31, 2022, to the extent permitted by Law, the Guarantor and the Purchaser shall and shall cause their Affiliates (including the Group Companies) to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to maximize Annual Revenue subject to, for new contracts, requirements regarding appropriate margins, to be agreed upon with the Sellers’ Representative on a case to case basis before the award of any such new contract to one or more of the Group Companies (such agreement not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require the Guarantor and the Purchaser or their Affiliates to take the following actions (to the extent they would otherwise be considered Commercially Reasonable Efforts): (a) shift or allocate revenue or business opportunities from the Guarantor, the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Guarantor or the Purchaser to the Group Companies, (b) attempt to accelerate revenue within such period or from future periods, (c) otherwise take any actions or omit to take any actions if such actions or omissions could reasonably be expected to be detrimental to the revenue of the Guarantor and its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) taken as a whole, except if such expectation would result from change in strategy decided by the Guarantor or any of its Affiliates (including the Group Companies).

e.
The Purchaser shall provide the Sellers’ Representative with a draft of the 2020 Revenue, the 2021 Revenue or the 2022 Revenue, as appropriate, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the relevant release from the Deferred Capex Escrow Account and take into consideration all reasonable comments of the Sellers’ Representative prior to such release. The Purchaser shall furthermore, subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings being entered into, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law and reasonably required for such review, provide the Sellers’ Representative (and its advisors) upon its request reasonable access, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to all relevant documents, books, records and working papers used in preparation of or useful for verifying the respective Revenue and shall cause the internal accounting personnel of the Group Companies to fully cooperate with and assist the Sellers’ Representative (and its advisors) with its review. The Sellers agree that any review undertaken pursuant to the access granted under this Clause 3.5.5 shall be conducted in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business or otherwise result in any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by personnel of the Group Companies of their normal duties.
The Sellers’ Representative shall have thirty (30) Business Days from the date it receives the 2020 Revenue, the 2021 Revenue or the 2022 Revenue (the “Revenue Review Period”) to review the respective Revenue, and to inform the Purchaser in writing of any disagreement (a “Revenue Objection”) with the calculation thereof. If the Sellers’ Representative raises no Revenue Objection within such thirty (30) Business Day period, the respective Revenue shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Sellers’ Representative (for and on behalf of the Sellers) and shall become binding upon the Sellers and the Purchaser.
If the Sellers’ Representative delivers a Revenue Objection to the Purchaser within such thirty (30) Business Day period, the Purchaser and the Sellers’ Representative, for and on behalf of the Sellers, shall then attempt in good faith to resolve their disagreement(s) within thirty (30) Business Days from the time the Revenue Objection is received (the “Revenue Resolution Period”). If the Sellers’ Representative, for and on behalf of the Sellers, and the Purchaser are unable to resolve their disagreement(s) with respect to the respective Revenue within the Revenue Resolution Period, such dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Auditor in accordance with Clause 3.4.
Regardless of whether the Sellers’ Representative has informed the Purchaser of any Revenue Objection in accordance with this Clause 3.5.5 (or whether the Sellers’ Representative is still reviewing such draft during the Revenue Review Period), if the draft Revenue provided by the Purchaser to the Sellers’ Representative for the relevant year pursuant to Clause 3.5.5 does not equal or exceed the corresponding Target Revenue, the appropriate amount pursuant to Clause 3.5.1, 3.5.2 or 3.5.3 will be released from the Deferred Capex Escrow Account to the Purchaser in accordance with the Deferred Capex Escrow Agreement on February 28 of the year following the year of the draft Revenue (e.g., on February 28, 2021 with respect to the draft 2020 Revenue) as provided in Clause 3.5.1, 3.5.2 or 3.5.3. If the Independent Auditor determines that an amount has been released to the Purchaser further to Clause 3.5.1, Clause 3.5.2 or Clause 3.5.3 although it should have been released to the Sellers because the respective Revenue had not been correctly determined, the Purchaser will promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the Independent Auditor’s decision pay the Sellers the respective amount received from the Deferred Capex Escrow Account.


EXHIBIT 10.5

f.
The Sellers and the Purchaser shall take all actions and execute and deliver all documents to the Escrow Agent reasonably required pursuant to the Deferred Capex Escrow Agreement to effect any release from the Deferred Capex Escrow Account pursuant to this Clause 3.5.

The Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers in advance of any notification, submission, response or other communication which it proposes to make or submit to any Regulatory Authorities pursuant to Clause 4.4.1 (including, but not limited to the submission of pre-notifications, appearances, presentations, memoranda, definitive filings and any proposed understandings, undertakings or agreements with the Regulatory Authorities) and at the same time provide the Sellers with drafts and copies thereof and any supporting documentation or information reasonably requested by the Sellers, it being understood that such copies or documentation may be redacted in order to avoid the communication of business secrets of the Purchaser. The Purchaser undertakes to take due consideration of any reasonable comments which the Sellers may have and to use its reasonable efforts to provide the Sellers with sufficient time to make such comments.

c.
The Purchaser agrees to keep the Sellers fully informed as to the progress of any enquiry by the Regulatory Authorities in the context of the Competition Condition.

d.
Where necessary to remove any impediments, restrictions, or conditions that prevent the fulfilment of the Competition Condition, the Purchaser agrees to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to offer and agrees to accept, in each of such jurisdictions, any remedies that are required to obtain such competition clearance that do not adversely impact the economic value of the Transaction to Purchaser (other than impacts that in the aggregate only have a De Minimis economic impact), it being stipulated for the avoidance of doubt that any remedy that includes a divestiture of any assets of the Group or the Purchaser’s Group shall be deemed to have a more than De Minimis economic impact. In this view and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, as soon as any Regulatory Authority reasonably expresses, formally or informally to Purchaser, any concerns about the impact of the Transaction, the Purchaser shall promptly inform the Sellers and their legal advisors and keep them informed in advance of the measures that the Purchaser is considering to take, or the commitments that it is considering to propose, in order to resolve these concerns as the case may be.
 
4.5
Notification of satisfaction of Conditions Precedent

a.
The Parties shall keep each other promptly informed of any progress towards the satisfaction of the Conditions Precedent and shall notify the other Parties immediately upon and not later than one (1) Business Day after becoming aware of the satisfaction of any of the Conditions Precedent.

b.
The Sellers shall notify the Purchaser immediately upon and not later than one (1) Business Day after becoming aware of any (executive) order or judgment restricting the Closing of the envisaged Transaction as set out in Clause 4.1.1.

c.
The Purchaser shall, in reliance on the information provided by the Group Companies and the Sellers, investigate and decide whether the proposed Transaction will have to be notified to any Regulatory Authority in accordance with applicable Antitrust Law, and the Purchaser will be solely liable (subject to the immediately following sentence), including vis-à-vis the Sellers, for any liabilities or fines resulting from the lack of notification, the late notification and/or the lack of clearance in any jurisdiction, subject to the Sellers, in accordance with their undertaking in Clause 4.4.1, having reasonably cooperated with, and having caused the Group Companies to reasonably cooperate with, the Purchaser by providing all reasonably required information to the extent reasonably able to produce and assisting the Purchaser in making its proper analysis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the analysis of the Purchaser is based on information provided by the Group Companies or the Sellers, the Sellers shall be liable vis-à-vis the Purchaser for any damage resulting from such information being materially incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete.

4.6
Failure to satisfy the Conditions Precedent

a.
If any of the Conditions Precedent, which has not been waived in accordance with Clause 4.3.2, becomes impossible to satisfy before the Long Stop Date, each of the Parties shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving five (5) Business Days advance notice to the other Parties. Provided that the Conditions Precedent are not all waived or satisfied in accordance with this Agreement within such five (5) Business Days notice period, this Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of such five (5) Business Days period. If the Parties do not issue any notice pursuant to this Clause and any of the Conditions Precedent remains unsatisfied on the Long Stop Date, this Agreement shall in any case automatically terminate on the Long Stop Date by force of law and without need for notice.

b.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Clause 4.6.1 above, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate except for this Clause 4.6.2 and Clauses 1 (Definition and Interpretation), 17 (Confidentiality), 19 (Notices), 24 (Costs and Expenses), 25 (General Provisions) and 26 (Governing Law and Competent Courts), which shall survive


EXHIBIT 10.5

the termination of this Agreement. Such termination shall occur without any liability of any Party to the other Party, provided the fact that a Condition Precedent has not been satisfied does not result from a breach of a Party’s obligations under this Clause 4 (in which case such Party will become liable towards the other Party).

5

b.
such action constitutes a transaction bonus or similar incentive payment that has become due and payable in connection with the Transaction;

c.
such action is required by any applicable Law or is consistent with past practice; or

such action has been made in view of a timely and proper performance of any of the Transaction Documents, including, for the avoidance of doubt, terminating the agreements with the Resigning Directors or Resigning Officers and any payments to any of the Resigning Directors, other than the Sellers and their Affiliated companies, in respect of the termination of their agreements; or

e.
such action is disclosed in Schedule 4.

For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts expressed in euro in this 6.1.3 shall be converted into US dollar at the Guaranteed Exchange Rate, if relevant.
d.
In applying and enforcing Clause 6.1 the Sellers and the Purchaser shall act vis-à-vis each other in accordance with the principles of reasonableness and fairness giving due consideration to all relevant circumstances.

If the Purchaser does not respond to the proposed action within such five (5) Business Day response period, it shall be deemed to have approved the Sellers’ request for consent. The Purchaser shall reply within two (2) Business Days in writing to Sellers’ requests for consent under the other provisions of this Clause 6.1.3, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If the Purchaser


EXHIBIT 10.5

does not respond to the proposed action within such two (2) Business Day response period, it shall be deemed to have approved the Sellers’ request for consent.

6.3
Financing Cooperation

a.
The Sellers shall cause the Group Companies to provide to Guarantor, and shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause representatives of the Group Companies to provide to Guarantor, on a reasonably timely basis, all cooperation reasonably requested by Guarantor in connection with the arrangement and marketing of any debt financing (including any issuance of debt securities by Guarantor or Purchaser) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder and the repayment of the indebtedness listed on Schedule 5, including by: (i) furnishing Guarantor and its financing sources as promptly as reasonably practicable with such financial and other pertinent information regarding the Group Companies as may be reasonably requested by Guarantor or Guarantor’s financing sources, including access to and cooperation with the Company’s accountants, (ii) reasonably cooperating with Guarantor’s financing sources and their respective agents with respect to their due diligence, including by giving access to documents relating to the Group Companies for diligence in connection with capital markets transactions,(iii) furnishing Guarantor and Guarantor’s financing sources promptly with all documentation and other information required by any Governmental Authority under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, (iv) arranging for customary payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing Date of the outstanding indebtedness of the Group and any outstanding financial instruments, listed in Schedule 5, (v) facilitating the execution and delivery at the Closing of definitive documents related to any debt financing at the Closing (provided that no obligation of the Group Companies under any such document shall be effective prior to Closing) and (vi) assisting Guarantor in the satisfaction of conditions precedent set forth in any debt financing to the extent the satisfaction of such conditions requires the cooperation of or is within the control of the Group Companies. Nothing in this Clause 6.3.1 shall require such cooperation to an extent that would reasonably interfere with the business or operations of any Group Company; if, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, additional resources must be hired to allow any Group Company to do so, the reasonable expenses thereof shall be borne by the Purchaser. The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Group Companies in connection with the syndication or marketing of any debt financing, provided that such logos are not used in a manner that would reasonably be expected to harm or disparage the Group Companies or their marks and that such documentation explicitly states that Closing has not yet occurred.

b.
Guarantor shall (i) promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Group Companies in connection with the cooperation of the Group Companies contemplated by Clause 6.3.1 and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Group Companies and their respective directors, officers and representatives from, against and in respect of any losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted against, any of them, directly or indirectly relating to, arising out of or resulting from the arrangement of any debt financing by Guarantor, any other cooperation pursuant to Clause 6.3, and/or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except to the extent such losses arise out of fraud or willful misconduct of the Group Companies.

c.
For the avoidance of doubt, none of the financing transactions referred to in this Clause 6.3 shall have any negative impact on the Net Debt or the Net Working Capital.

6.4
Works Council

The Sellers have or shall in due time inform and consult with the employees and their representatives, if any, to the extent required by Law.

Further assurance with respect to the NMTC Loan Agreement

acquire under the NMTC Loan Agreement in connection with the Transaction, including, without limitation, any termination right, right to declare a breach or event of default, or right to alter the terms of the NMTC Loan Agreement.
7
SELLERS’ WARRANTIES

7.1
The Sellers represent and warrant to the Purchaser that the statements set out in Schedule 2 (the “Sellers’ Representations and Warranties”) are true and accurate on the Signing Date or on any such earlier date as of which any Sellers’ Representation or Warranty is expressly made.

7.2
The Sellers represent and warrant to the Purchaser that the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties shall be true and accurate in all material respects on the Closing Date or on any such earlier date as of which any Sellers’ Representation or Warranty is expressly made.

7.3
Without prejudice to Clause 25.1 and 25.2, the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties are the only representations or assurances of any kind given by or on behalf of the Sellers and collectively and exhaustively reflect characteristics that the Purchaser may reasonably expect the Shares, the Group and its business to have. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it has not entered into this Agreement in reliance on any representation or warranty other than the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties and other than with respect to the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties waives to the fullest extent possible or permitted under any applicable Law all rights and remedies which might otherwise be available to it in respect of any such representations, warranties, other assurances, statements, promises or forecasts (whether written or oral).

7.4
In no event are any representations or warranties, express or implied, given by the Sellers with respect to forecasts, plans, expectations, the feasibility of any business plans or the future development of the business of any Group Company and, more broadly, to any fact, circumstance or event dated after the Signing Date (other than with respect to the accuracy of the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties as of the Closing Date in Clause 7.2), or as the case may be, any such earlier date as of which any of the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties is expressly made, irrespective of whether these have been explicitly included in any disclosed document or information.

7.5
The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it has performed, with the assistance of professional advisors, an extensive due diligence investigation with respect to the Shares, the Group Companies and their respective businesses, activities, operation, assets, liabilities and financial condition during the period from 8 November 2017 until the Signing Date on the basis of the information provided by the Sellers and their advisers - amongst others - by way of data room documents in the Data Room, management presentations and expert calls and the related Q&A process (the “Due Diligence Investigation”). The Purchaser acknowledges that the Due Diligence Investigation was in a form, scope and substance to the Purchaser’s satisfaction and that it has raised with the Sellers any and all specific issues which it considered relevant in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and obtained satisfactory answers from the Sellers on all its queries.

7.6
The information contained in the Data Room (an index of which is included in Schedule 3), this Agreement including the Schedules hereto, the Information Memorandum and the written answers to questions raised by the Purchaser and its advisors (copies of which are also included in Schedule 3), any other information made available to the Purchaser and its advisors in writing, in interviews, in process letters, in (management or other) presentations (written records of these interviews; process letters and (management or other) presentations are also included in Schedule 3) or in any other form, and all other information which is in the public domain in each case as of the date hereof shall together be considered the disclosed information (the “Disclosed Information”).

8
INDEMNIFICATION

8.1
The Sellers shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser harmless from and against any Damage resulting from a breach of any of the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties (a “Breach”), it being understood that (without prejudice to Clause 9.11) (i) for purposes of computing the amount of any Damage indemnifiable to the Purchaser, both the Damages suffered by the Damages suffered by the Purchaser and/or any Group Company (as if they had been incurred by the Purchaser, but without duplication) shall be taken into account, (ii) any Damage incurred by a Group Company shall be deemed to be incurred by the Purchaser in the same amount, multiplied by the percentage of the (direct or indirect) shareholding of the Purchaser in the relevant Group Company acquired in the framework of this Transaction (save with respect to ASCO Finance USA NV, where the percentage shall deemed to be 100 %) and maintained up to the moment the Damages are finally determined, either by mutual agreement among the Parties or in a final, non-appealable decision in accordance with Clause 26.


EXHIBIT 10.5

It is thus specified for the avoidance of doubt that the Sellers thus covenant to indemnify the Purchaser for any Breach up to the amount as is required to put the Purchaser and/or the Group Companies (if the Damages would have been indemnifiable to the Group Companies) into the position that it and/or the Group Companies would have been in, had the Breach not occurred (save for any difference that may result from the application of the Spot Exchange Rate, if relevant).
8.2
In the event of a Breach the Purchaser shall submit to the Sellers a claim for compensation (a “Claim”).

8.3
The Purchaser shall, after discovery of the circumstances giving rise to such Claim, promptly and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date on which the Purchaser becomes aware or should have become aware of the relevant fact, circumstance or matter, notify the Sellers giving such particulars of the underlying facts as may reasonably be required for a normally prudent seller to be able to understand the Claim and assess it on its merits to the extent then available (a “Claim Notice”). The Claim must also set out in reasonable detail the fact, circumstance or matter giving rise to the Claim and the relevant provisions of this Agreement on which it is based, and specify the Purchaser’s best estimate of its likely amount to the extent then available. Failure to comply with any of the requirements set forth in this Clause 8.3 shall not result in the Purchaser forfeiting its right to claim Damages for a Breach, but limit such right to the extent the liability of the Sellers would have been increased as a result thereof.

8.4
The Sellers will respond to the Claim Notice (a “Claim Response”) within twenty (20) Business Days (the “Response Period”) after the date that the Claim Notice is given.

8.5
In connection with any Claim made by the Purchaser against the Sellers, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group Companies, to make available to the Sellers on an ongoing basis all such information as the Sellers may reasonably require for assessing, disputing, resisting, appealing, compromising, defending, remedying or mitigating the Claim. If and to the extent reasonably required for the purposes of assessing, disputing, resisting, appealing, compromising, defending, remedying or mitigating the Claim, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group Companies, to grant reasonable access to the Group Companies’ management and premises, provided that the obligations of the Purchaser under this Clause 8.5 are limited to information required for the Sellers’ defence under the Claim (as the case may be a third party claim).

8.6
If the Sellers dispute the Claim, the Parties will meet promptly to try to amicably resolve the Claim. If the Parties fail to amicably resolve the Claim within twenty (20) Business Days of the Claim Response, then the Claim will be considered unresolved and will be resolved in accordance with Clause 26. The Purchaser will have until the later of (i) sixty (60) Business Days after giving the Claim Notice and (ii) two (2) years after the Closing Date to submit the Claim to arbitration in accordance with Clause 26. If the Purchaser fails to submit the Claim to arbitration within this period, the Claim will be deemed dismissed and resolved, and will not be thereafter reasserted.

8.7
If the Sellers elect not to dispute a Claim described in a Claim Notice, whether by failing to give a timely Claim Response or otherwise, then the Sellers will be deemed to have agreed to pay the amount of such Claim to the Purchaser. The Escrow Agent shall release such amount from the Escrow Amount to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and to the extent that such Escrow Amount is not sufficient to satisfy the Claim, then the Sellers shall promptly pay such required balance of such Claim to the Purchaser.

8.8
If any amount is to be released from the Escrow Account to the Purchaser in respect of Damages incurred in EUR, in order to determine the amount of USD to be released from the Escrow Account, such Damages will converted to USD at the relevant Spot Exchange Rate. If any Seller is to make a payment directly (as opposed to through a release of funds from the Escrow Account) to the Purchaser pursuant to such Seller’s indemnification obligations under this Agreement, such payment shall be made in the currency of the relevant Damages incurred by the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company.

8.9
Any payment made by a Seller in respect of a Breach shall be deemed to be a reduction of the part of the Final Purchase Price that such Seller has received hereunder.

8.10
The Purchaser acknowledges that the right to claim indemnification in accordance with this Clause 8 (subject to the limitations set out in this Agreement) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser in respect of any Breach under this Agreement. The Purchaser expressly and irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all rights and remedies it might have under Belgian law or otherwise in respect of any Breach, including the right to seek the termination of this Agreement in court (at any time, including after Closing) pursuant to section 1184 of the Belgian Civil Code.


EXHIBIT 10.5

8.11
If the receipt of any amount of Damages results in an effective Tax payment by the Purchaser, the amount payable shall be grossed up by such amount as will ensure that after effective payment of such Tax there shall be left a sum equal to the amount which would otherwise be payable, it being understood that if at the time of payment of the Damages the exact amount of such Taxes cannot be determined, the Parties shall take into account a fair estimate of such Taxes in order to determine the amount of Damages. Such estimate shall be adjusted as soon as the actual amount of Taxes has been determined and paid.
8.12
The Sellers and the Purchaser shall take all actions and execute and deliver all documents to the Escrow Agent reasonably required pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to effect any release from the Escrow Account contemplated by this Agreement.

9
LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION

9.1
Disclosure

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall not be in Breach (as defined above), and shall not be liable in respect of any Breach to the extent that, at Signing, the Purchaser was or should have been aware of such Breach, because the facts and circumstances giving rise thereto:
a.
were Fairly Disclosed to the Purchaser on the basis of the Disclosed Information; or

b.
have been Fairly Disclosed, or excepted, in the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties themselves and/or otherwise in this Agreement and/or in the schedules hereto.

9.2
Minimum claims and basket

a.
No indemnification shall be due for any individual Breach in respect of which the amount of the Damages to which the Purchaser would otherwise be entitled is less than USD 100,000 (USD hundred thousand); provided, that, for the purpose of determining if such threshold is exceeded, Damages incurred in EUR shall be converted into USD at the relevant Spot Exchange Rate. Claims arising from similar related facts, matters or circumstances shall be aggregated for the purposes of this Clause 9.2.1.

b.
The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover any Damages in respect of any Breach unless the aggregate amount of Damages in respect of all Breaches for which indemnification is owed exceeds USD 3,000,000 (USD three million); provided, that, for the purpose of determining if such threshold is exceeded, Damages incurred in EUR shall be converted into USD at the relevant Spot Exchange Rate (the “Basket”), it being understood that (i) in case the Basket is exceeded the full amount shall be due including the amount of the Basket and (ii) Breaches for which the Sellers are not held to indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to Clause 9.2.1 are not taken into account to calculate the Basket.

9.3
Maximum liability

The maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers under this Agreement shall not exceed USD 92,500,000 (USD ninety-two million five hundred thousand); provided, that, for the purpose of determining if such threshold is exceeded, Damages incurred in EUR shall be converted into USD at the relevant Spot Exchange Rate.
9.4
Time limitations

Without prejudice to Clause 8.3, the Sellers shall not be in Breach (as defined above), and shall not be liable in respect of any Breach unless a Claim is given:
a.
for all Breaches other than for Breaches of the Title Warranties and the Tax Warranties, eighteen (18) months after Closing;

b.
for Breaches of the Title Warranties, ten (10) years and three (3) months after Closing; and

c.
for Breaches of the Tax Warranties, before or on the date on which the matter giving rise to the Claim is barred by applicable statute of limitation increased with three (3) months.

9.5
Contingent liabilities
The Sellers shall have no obligation to reimburse Damages to the Purchaser in respect of any liability which is contingent (“voorwaardelijke of latente verbintenis” / “obligation conditionnelle ou éventuelle”) unless and until such contingent liability


EXHIBIT 10.5

has become an actual liability and is due and payable, provided, however, that this Clause 9.5 shall not have the effect of preventing the Purchaser from validly making a Claim in respect of a contingent liability within the time limit specified in Clause 9.4, even though it has not become an actual liability. For the avoidance of doubt, any Claim may validly be made in respect of a contingent liability if and only if (and to the extent only that) the Purchaser (i) has a present (but not yet due and payable) obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and (ii) it is probable (i.e., more likely than not) that an outflow of economic resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. To the extent reasonably possible at the time of making the Claim, the Purchaser shall include therein an estimate of the amount of the Damages, provided that the amount thus set forth shall not operate as a limitation on the right of the Purchaser to subsequently be indemnified for all Damages, even if higher.
9.6
Provisions for liabilities

The Sellers shall have no obligation to reimburse Damages to the Purchaser in respect of any Claim if and to the extent that the matter giving rise to the Claim is accounted or provided for in the Closing Accounts and was reflected in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price.
9.7
Insurance proceeds and recoveries from third parties

a.
The Sellers shall have no obligation to reimburse the Purchaser in respect of any Claim if and to the extent that the Damages in respect of which the Claim is made (i) are covered by an insurance policy in force at the level of a Group Company at the Closing Date, (ii) would have been covered if such an insurance policy had been maintained beyond the Closing Date or (iii) are effectively recovered from any other third party.

b.
The Purchaser shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain recovery in respect of any Damages from any third party indemnity which is available in respect of Damages as soon as possible. If the Purchaser receives such proceeds or indemnification recovery in connection with Damages for which it has been indemnified hereunder, the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers and refund to the Sellers the amount of such proceeds or indemnification recoveries when received.

9.8
Tax Savings

a.
Any amount owed by the Sellers in respect of any Claim shall be reduced by the amount of any Tax Savings for the relevant Group Company arising from the Damages in respect of which the Claim has been made.

b.
If the amount of the Tax Savings is determined after payment by the Sellers of any amount in discharge of the Claim, the Purchaser shall pay, or shall procure that the relevant Group Company pays, to the Sellers an amount equal to the difference between:

1.
the amount paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser; and

2.
the amount that the Purchaser would have received if such Tax Savings had been taken into account in determining the amount due by the Sellers in accordance with this Clause 9.8

c.

EXHIBIT 10.5

9.10
Matters arising subsequent to Closing

The Sellers shall have no obligation to reimburse Damages to the Purchaser in respect of any Damages to the extent that the same would not have occurred but for any action or omission of a Group Company, the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser, after Closing, nor in respect of any Damages resulting from or triggered by any investigation or claim initiated following any initiative taken by a Group Company, the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser, after the Closing Date, unless such action, initiative or omission is an action, initiative or omission which a similarly situated internationally active industrial buyer, whether or not listed, engaging in a transaction of size and nature as the Transaction would as shareholder of the Group Companies undertake or omit to undertake or cause the Group Companies to undertake or omit to undertake with due regard for the interests of such buyer as shareholder in preserving the value of its investment in the Group Companies and their assets.

If the same Damages can give rise to a Claim under several provisions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall only be required to reimburse such Damages once, subject to the limitations set out herein.
9.12
Mitigation
Without prejudice to section 1134, para. 3 of the Belgian Civil Code, the Purchaser shall procure that all reasonable steps are taken to avoid or mitigate any Damages which might give rise to a Claim against the Sellers.
9.13
Absence of Limitation of Liability
None of the limitations contained in Clause 9 (other than Clause 9.11) shall apply to and the Purchaser shall be entitled to full indemnification for any Damage resulting from any Breach which is the consequence of fraud (“dol” / “bedrog”) or wilful misconduct (“opzet” / “faute intentionelle”) by the Sellers or is the consequence of fraud (“dol” / “bedrog”) or wilful misconduct (“opzet” / “faute intentionelle”) by the Group Companies which was known to the Sellers at the Signing Date and not Fairly Disclosed to the Purchaser prior to the Signing Date, it being understood that in determining the amount of Damages due regard shall nevertheless be given to any insurance proceeds, recoveries from third parties and/or tax savings that would be unaffected by the foregoing.

SPECIFIC INDEMNITY

10.1
General
The Sellers agree to fully indemnify and hold the Purchaser harmless for any and all Damages incurred by the Purchaser and/or the Group Companies in respect thereof, resulting or arising from, to the extent not taken into account in the calculation of Net Working Capital or Net Debt:
a.
(i) any and all Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Group Companies, or for which any of the Group Companies may otherwise be liable, for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending at Closing, (ii) any and all Taxes of any other person for which any of the Group Companies is or has been liable as a transferee or successor, where such liability results from circumstances existing prior to the Closing, and (iii) any obligation or other liability of any of the Group Companies to indemnify any other person in respect of or relating to Taxes or for any amounts calculated by reference to Taxes or to pay an amount pursuant to any Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreement entered into prior to the Closing Date (other than any such agreement solely among the Group Companies or that was entered into in the ordinary course of business and the principal purpose of which does not relate to Taxes);
excluding (i) any liability for Taxes due as a result of the Closing (including but not limited to stamp duties, real estate transfer taxes, etc.) and (ii) any liability for taxes in relation to the NMTC Loan Agreement resulting or arising from the Transaction or any actions or circumstances after Closing.

any environmental liabilities relating to the ownership or operation of the Business or any property by any of the Group Companies prior to Closing, including any release or presence of any Hazardous Substance in the Environment or in any structure prior to the Closing Date, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, including any liabilities or any remedial action (including, without limitation, soil investigations, clean-up and monitoring measures) relating to (known or unknown) soil or groundwater pollution existing prior to Closing which originated on the property owned, operated or leased by any of the Group Companies in Belgium, until the Flemish Soil Regulatory Authority (“OVAM”) confirms that no further remedial action is required because (i) the applicable standards for soil and groundwater are complied with; or (ii) the pollution no longer constitutes a risk for adverse effects on the environment or human health and safety;

c.
the claims referred to in Schedule 12;


EXHIBIT 10.5

d.
the fact that the provision accounted for in accounts no. 459620 and 459630 of Asco Industries NV/SA is insufficient to cover the risk for which it has been reserved up to Closing;

e.
the operations of Asco Brazil;

f.

11
THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

11.1
Without prejudice to Clause 8.3, where a Claim of the Purchaser is based upon or relates to a claim by or a liability to a third party (a “Third Party Claim”), the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers of such Third Party Claim within five (5) Business Days after such Third Party Claim has been made, or sooner if this is reasonably required in order to properly prepare the defence against such Third Party Claim or if urgent actions may be required. Failure to comply with any of the requirements set forth in this Clause 11.1 shall not result in the Purchaser forfeiting its right to claim Damages for a Breach, but limit such right to the extent the liability of the Sellers would have been increased as a result thereof.

11.2
The Purchaser shall, or shall cause the relevant Group Company to, provide the Sellers with copies of all documents and correspondence from that third party, and all other documents and correspondence relating to the Third Party Claim as the Sellers may reasonably request, it being understood that the Sellers hereby agree (i) to keep all such information and documents confidential during a three (3) year period as of the receipt thereof, and (ii) to use such information only for the purpose of dealing with the Third Party Claim and the impact thereof on this Agreement.

11.3
The Sellers shall promptly and not later than twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim notify to the Purchaser: (i) whether they dispute the Purchaser’s or the relevant Group Company’s right to indemnification from the Sellers with respect to such Third Party Claim; and (ii) if they do not dispute such right of indemnification, whether or not they desire to defend the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company against such Third Party Claim.

11.4
Notwithstanding the above notice periods, the Purchaser is allowed to take any reasonable provisional measures, to the extent necessary, subject to informing the Sellers promptly thereof.


EXHIBIT 10.5

11.5
If, within the 20 (twenty) Business Days’ period provided for under Clause 11.2, the Sellers notify the Purchaser that they do not dispute the Purchaser’s right to indemnification and desire to defend the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company against such Third Party Claim, the Sellers shall have the right to assume and control the defence of such Third Party Claim by appropriate proceedings with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser at the Sellers’ sole cost and expense; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the resolution of such Third Party Claim could have a material impact on Guarantor’s reputation or materially interfere with Guarantor’s business or its relationships with its key customers, the Sellers shall not have the right to assume the control and defence of such Third Party Claim, subject to any increase in the amount of Damages indemnifiable by the Sellers further to this Agreement as a result of such defence to the extent it would be different from the defence that would have been pursued by the Sellers, being disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of Damages indemnifiable. The Purchaser’s approval of counsel proposed by the Sellers shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Purchaser may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in, but not control, any such defence or settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to claims related to the matters listed in Schedule 12, the Purchaser and Christian Boas shall jointly control and direct the defence of such claims, it being understood that they shall, acting reasonably, (i) jointly select counsel with respect to each such claim and (ii) actively consult and cooperate with each other in directing the defence of such claims.

11.6
If the Sellers:

i.dispute the Purchaser’s right to compensation with respect to a Third Party Claim; or

ii.do not dispute such right to compensation but prefer not to assume the defence of such Third Party Claim; or

iii.do not react within twenty (20) Business Days to the Purchaser’s notification, and within ten (10) Business days after a second notice by the Purchaser, after expiration of said initial period, asserting the Purchaser’s intention to assume control of the legal defence of the Third Party Claim if the Sellers do not respond; or

iv.do not dispute such right to compensation but fail to timely assume and prosecute the defence of such Third Party Claim;

then the Purchaser shall assume and control the defence of such Third Party Claim, provided that the Sellers shall have the right to assume the defence against a Third Party Claim, if at any time the Purchaser is not conducting the defence against such Third Party Claim in a reasonably diligent manner.
11.7
The Party responsible for the defence of any Third Party Claim (the “Responsible Party”) shall, to the extent reasonably requested by the other Parties, keep informed and, when appropriate, consult with the other Parties, on the status of any Third Party Claim for which such Party is not the Responsible Party, including, without limitation, all proposed settlement negotiations. With respect to a Third Party Claim for which the Sellers are the Responsible Party, the Purchaser shall make or cause the relevant Group Company to make available to the Sellers and their representatives all books and records relating to such Third Party Claim and shall render to the Sellers such assistance and access to the relevant Group Company as may be necessary or useful for purposes of the defence, as provided in this Clause 11.

11.8
The Responsible Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of each settlement offer (including whether the Responsible Party is willing or not to accept the proposed settlement offer) with respect to a Third Party Claim. The other Parties agree to notify the Responsible Party in due course whether or not such Parties are willing to accept the proposed settlement offer. The Responsible Party shall not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

11.9
If the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company does not consent to any settlement offer of a Third Party Claim (whether or not the Purchaser is the Responsible Party) that the Sellers agree to take responsibility for, the Purchaser or such Group Company may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such event, the maximum liability of the Seller with respect to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the full amount of such settlement offer.

11.10
If the Sellers do not consent to any settlement offer of a Third Party Claim (whether or not the Sellers are the Responsible Party with respect to such Third Party Claim), the Sellers may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such event, the Sellers shall be liable to the Purchaser for the full amount of the Damage sustained by the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company as a result of such Third Party Claim (without prejudice, for the avoidance of doubt, to the limitations set forth in Clause 9, which continue to apply).

For the avoidance of doubt, none of the limitations set out in Clauses 7, 8 and 9 shall apply to a breach of any obligation of a Party resting on it further to this Agreement, other than a Breach, or in respect of any Specific Indemnity set out in Clause 10 to the extent applicable.

25.2
Save as explicitly provided in this Agreement, the Parties waive their rights, if any and whether in whole or in part, to annul, rescind, dissolve, terminate or cancel this Agreement, or to request such annulment, rescission, dissolution, termination or cancellation after Closing, including on the basis of general provisions of contract law (including section 1184 of the Belgian Civil Code). This Clause 25.2 shall not exclude any liability for (or remedy in respect of) fraud nor prevent a party to seek enforcement in kind of any of its rights and/or indemnification in case of breach of an obligation by another Party.

25.3
The Purchaser shall not direct (and shall cause the Group Companies not to direct) any claim to any of the Resigning Directors or the Resigning Officers of the Group Companies referred to in Clause 5.2.3. The Purchaser shall exercise its rights as a direct or indirect shareholder of the Group Companies in a way that avoids any personal liability of the Resigning Directors and the Resigning Officers referred to in Clause 5.2.3. In particular, to the extent legally permissible, the Purchaser agrees to vote against the enforcement of claims of any Group Company against the Resigning Directors or Resigning Officers referred to in Clause 5.2.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing is without prejudice to the Purchaser’s right to direct a claim against the Sellers in their capacity as Sellers under this Agreement (on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement).

25.4
If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court or arbitral tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The Parties undertake to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision by a provision which achieves the original purpose and intention of the Parties to the fullest possible extent.

25.5
The nullity or non-applicability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or applicability of other provisions of the Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

25.6
No Party shall be deemed to have waived any rights or remedies arising out of this Agreement or out of any default or breach hereunder unless such Party executes the waiver in writing. If a Party waives a right or remedy arising out of this Agreement or out of any default or breach hereunder, such waiver shall not be construed to constitute a waiver of any other rights or remedies.

25.7
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements among the Parties with respect to its subject matter and constitutes a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement among the Parties with respect to its subject matter, except for the confidentiality agreement dated 3 July 2017 among Asco Industries NV and Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. (the “Confidentiality Agreement”), as amended by (i) an agreement entered into by and among the Company, Asco Industries NV and Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. on 14 November 2017 (the “First Addendum”), (ii) an agreement entered into by and among the Company, Asco Industries NV and Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. on 12 March 2018 (the “Second Addendum”), (iii) an agreement entered into by and among the Company, Asco Industries NV and Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. on 26 February 2018 (the “Third Addendum”), and (iii) an agreement entered into by and among the Company, Asco Industries NV and Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. on 26 April 2018 (the “Fourth Addendum”) and which will remain in full force up until Closing.

25.8
This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement by and among the Parties.


EXHIBIT 10.5

26.
GOVERNING LAW AND COMPETENT COURTS

26.1
This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Belgium, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws, to the extent such principles or rules would permit or require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.
26.2
Any disputes in connection with or arising out of this Agreement that are not settled amicably shall be conclusively settled by way of arbitration under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) (the “Rules”) by three arbitrators, whereby each Party shall appoint one (1) arbitrator in accordance with said Rules as in force at the time of the request for arbitration and the two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall jointly appoint a third arbitrator, who shall act as chairman, in accordance with said Rules. If the Party-appointed arbitrators do not agree on the identity of the third arbitrator he shall be appointed in accordance with said Rules. The place of the arbitration shall be London. The arbitral proceedings and all documents delivered to or by the arbitrators shall be conducted in English. The arbitrators’ decision shall be final and binding on the Parties. The arbitrators must decide on which share of the costs each Party shall bear, which shares may not be equal as a consequence of the respective responsibility of each Party in the origin of the dispute or its continuation. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing is without prejudice to the right of a Party to seek injunctive relief in summary proceedings before any competent court and to submit a dispute in relation to the Price Adjustment to an Independent Auditor in accordance with Clauses 3.3.4 and 3.4.

This Agreement has been signed in six (6) counterparts, which is as many counterparts as the number of Parties to it, and each party acknowledges receipt of one such counterpart.
Each of the Sellers hereby gives proxy to any lawyer of Eubelius CVBA and the Purchaser and the Guarantor hereby give proxy to any lawyer of Stibbe CVBA to initial on its behalf the pages of this Agreement (it being understood that the annexes have not been changed and that Parties have thus agreed not to initial them).
