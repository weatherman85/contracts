SECTION 1
INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS
1.1    Name of Plan; History. This Plan (formerly known as the “Target Corporation SMG Executive Officer Deferred Compensation Plan) is a non-qualified, unfunded plan established for the purpose of allowing a select group of management or highly compensated employees to defer the receipt of income. This Plan was originally adopted effective as of January 1, 1997 and was amended at various times thereafter. Effective April 30, 2002, Participants in this Plan who were members of the Company’s Corporate Operating Committee received credits under this Plan equal to the present value of their benefit under the supplemental pension plans maintained by the Company. Each subsequent April, the Participant receives annual SPP Benefit Transfer Credits equal to the change in value of his or her benefit under the supplemental pension plans. Effective July 31, 2002, this program was extended to include all officers of the Company. Effective April 30, 2002, Participants in this Plan who were members of the Company’s Corporate Operating Committee received credits under this Plan equal to the present value of their benefit under the Company’s ESBP. Each subsequent April, Participants received annual credits equal to the change in value of his or her benefit under the ESBP. Effective October 28, 2005, all officers who had not previously received ESBP Benefit Transfer Credits, received a one-time transfer of the present value of their benefit under the ESBP. As of January 28, 2006, a one-time ESBP credit was made to certain executive committee members and no subsequent ESBP Benefit Transfer Credits were made to those receiving the one-time ESBP credit. From time to time, certain participants in the Target Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan – Senior Management Group (“ODCP”) and the Company negotiated to transfer the economic value of their benefit under ODCP to this Plan. Officers eligible to receive performance share awards granted in the fiscal years ending February 1, 2003 and January 31, 2004 had an opportunity to defer receipt of the value of the earned performance shares into this Plan at the end of the performance period. The performance period for the shares granted in 2003 ended February 3, 2007. The performance period for the shares granted in 2004 ended February 2, 2008. Effective January 1, 2005 (and other effective dates as specifically provided), this Plan was operated in compliance with Code section 409A. Effective January 29, 2006, members of the Company’s executive committee ceased to be eligible to receive enhanced earnings on their account balances. The Plan, which is intended to comply with Code section 409A, was amended and restated effective January 1, 2009. The Plan was amended and restated to incorporate the Company’s recoupment policy effective January 13, 2010. The Plan was amended and restated to reflect Plan administration and amendment changes authorized by the Board on November 10, 2010, to modify the Change in Control definition, and to set forth special provisions that are applicable to certain Participants who transfer to Canada, effective as of June 8, 2011. The Plan was amended and restated to reflect the replacement of the Stable Value Crediting Rate Alternative with the Intermediate-Term Bond Crediting Rate Alternative beginning June 6, 2012, effective as of June 5, 2012. The Plan was amended and restated to revise the method for distributing the final SPP Transfer Credit following a Termination of Employment for amounts accruing on or after January 1, 2014, to clarify the differences between “executive officer” and “member of the executive committee,” and to clarify the timing of certain post-death payments, effective December 1, 2013. The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2014 to freeze that portion of the annual SPP Transfer Credit that arises from a positive accrual under SPP III after February 3, 2013 solely from treating the Participant as five years older than his or her actual age for purposes of determining the amount of the annual SPP Benefit Transfer Credit. The


Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2015 (i) to revise the participation rules for Participants who are transferred to Canada on a temporary basis, (ii) to modify the Restoration Match Credit determination to cover Participants who are entitled to differing qualified 401(k) plan matching contribution percentages, (iii) to change the phrase “member of the executive committee” to “executive Officer” each place the phrase appears, and (iv) to define the term executive Officer to mean a Section 16 officer or executive officer as defined under Federal securities laws. The Plan was amended and restated effective April 3, 2016, (i) to provide that the Restoration Match Credit will, under certain circumstances, be credited to a Participant’s Account prior to the end of the Plan Year, effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, (ii) to delete Appendix B – Participants on Temporary Assignment to Canada because it has ceased to be applicable, (iii) to clarify the definition of executive Officer as being an “executive officer” under Item 401 of Regulation S-K, and (iv) to remove unnecessary language from the recoupment provisions. The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2017 (i) to add a five (5) year vesting requirement for the Restoration Match Credits for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2016, (ii) to change the Enhancement from a monthly credit to an annual credit with an end of the year employment requirement, and (iii) to take advantage of some additional regulatory flexibility with respect to payments following death. The Plan was amended and restated effective May 1, 2017 to include rules about use of the Company Stock Fund Crediting Rate Alternative after Termination of Employment. The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2021, as provided in this Plan Statement, (i) to include a limitation on the frequency of changes made to the Company Stock Fund Crediting Rate Alternative, and (ii) to make miscellaneous updating changes to the Plan Statement. The Plan was amended and restated effective May 1, 2022, (i) to change the term “executive Officer” to “Leadership Team Member”, (ii) to define the term “Leadership Team Member,” and (iii) to make miscellaneous updating changes to the Plan Statement. The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2023, to provide that the when SPP Transfer Credits to Leadership Team Members are negative, the corresponding debit automatically occurs.

2.1.1    An Employee is eligible to participate in this Plan on the first day of a Plan Year if, on such day, he or she:

(b)    is an Officer.
2.1.2    A Newly Eligible Employee is eligible to participate in this Plan on the date that is 30 days after the date he or she satisfies the requirements in Section 2.1.1.
2.1.3    An Employee shall, as a condition of participation in this Plan, complete such forms and make such elections in accordance with Plan Rules as the Plan Administrator may require. An Employee who satisfies the requirements of this Section 2.1 is eligible to participate in this Plan in accordance with and subject to the requirements of this Plan.
2.1.4    An Employee who has had a Termination of Employment as defined in Section 1.2.44(b), will not be eligible to make deferral elections for subsequent Plan Years until otherwise notified by the Plan Administrator. Any deferral election in effect at the time of such Termination of Employment will continue to apply with respect to any Eligible Compensation received from a Participating Employer or other Affiliate. Such Employee will still be eligible to receive credits, if any, pursuant to Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.
2.2    Special Rules for Participating Employees. A Participant who transfers employment from one Participating Employer to another Affiliate, whether or not a Participating Employer, will, for the duration of the Plan Year in which the transfer occurs, continue to participate in this Plan in accordance with the deferral election in effect at the time of such transfer. To the extent agreed in writing by an Affiliate and the Plan Administrator, such a transferred Participant may continue to be eligible to participate in this Plan in subsequent Plan Years. A Participant who is simultaneously employed with more than one Participating Employer will participate in this Plan as an Employee of each such Participating Employer on the basis of a single deferral election applied separately to his or her respective, Eligible Compensation from each Participating Employer.

Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Plan Statement or by the Plan Administrator, an Employee who ceases to satisfy the requirements of Section 2.1 is not eligible to continue to participate in the Plan, provided, that any deferral elections in effect, and irrevocable, will continue to apply with respect to any Eligible Compensation received from a Participating Employer or other Affiliate.

If Enhancement, Deferral or Restoration Match Credits are due after the complete distribution of the Participant’s vested Account balance, or subaccount balance to which such Enhancement, Deferral or Restoration Match Credit relate, then such subsequent credits will be made to the Account and paid to the Participant in a single lump sum cash payment within 60 days of being credited to the Account.
(ii)    Installment Distribution. If Enhancement, Deferral or Restoration Match Credits are due after a related installment distribution occurs, then such subsequent credits will be made to the Account and included in the Account balance to determine the amount of the remaining scheduled payments as applicable.

23

(b)    SPP or ESBP Benefit Transfer Credit. The SPP Benefit Transfer Credit shall be distributed as follows:
(i)    For amounts accruing prior to January 1, 2014, in a single lump sum within 60 days following the Termination of Employment; and
(ii)    For amounts accruing on or after January 1, 2014,
(A)    If the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit is due after the complete distribution of the Participant’s vested Account balance, or subaccount balance to which such Credit relates, then such Credit will be made to the Account and paid to the Participant in a single lump sum payment within 60 days of being credited to the Account;
(B)    If the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit is due after a related installment distribution occurs, then such subsequent Credit will be made to the Account and included in the Account balance to determine the amount of the remaining scheduled payments as applicable; and
(C)    If the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit is due prior to the commencement of payment to which such credit relates, distribution shall be made at the time and in the manner elected by the Participant or pursuant to the Plan’s rule, all as provided in Section 6.2.2.
6.2.7    Vesting in Benefits After the Distribution Date. No portion of a Participant’s Account will be distributed prior to being vested. Subject to Section 6.3, if Participant is scheduled to receive a distribution of a portion of his or her Account that is not vested, such unvested amount will not be paid until subsequently vested, at which time it will be paid out in accordance with the respective distribution election.
6.2.8    No Spousal Rights. No spouse, former spouse, Beneficiary or other person shall have any right to participate in the Participant’s designation of a form or time of payment.
6.3    Six-Month Suspension for Specified Employees. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 6 to the contrary, if a Participant is a Specified Employee at Termination of Employment, then any distributions arising on account of the Participant’s Termination of Employment (other than on account of death) that are due shall be suspended and not be made until (6) months have elapsed since such Participant’s Termination of Employment (or, if earlier, upon the date of the Participant’s death). Any payments that were otherwise payable during the six-month suspension period referred to in the preceding sentence, will be paid within 60 days after the end of such six-month suspension period.
6.4    Distribution on Account of Death; Distribution Following Death. Upon the death of a Participant prior to Termination of Employment or other distribution trigger, the Participant’s Account balance will be paid to the Participant’s Beneficiary in a single lump sum as soon as practicable following the Participant’s death, but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant’s death occurs. Upon the death of a Participant following Termination of Employment or other distribution trigger,
24

distribution will continue in the same form and at the same time it was scheduled to be paid to the Participant, subject to Section 6.3, but will be paid in a single lump sum to the estate of the Beneficiary as soon as practicable following the Beneficiary’s death.
6.5    Distribution on Account of Unforeseeable Emergency.
6.5.1    When Available. A Participant may receive a distribution from the vested portion of his or her Account (which shall be deemed to include the deferral that would have been made but for the cancellation under Section 6.5.3) if the Plan Administrator determines that such distribution is on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency and the conditions in Section 6.5.2 have been fulfilled. To receive such a distribution, the Participant must request a distribution by filing an application with the Plan Administrator and furnish such supporting documentation as the Plan Administrator may require. In the application, the Participant shall specify the basis for the distribution and the dollar amount to be distributed. If such request is approved by the Plan Administrator, distribution shall be made in a lump sum payment within 60 days following the approval by the Plan Administrator of the completed application.
6.5.2    Limitations. The amount that may be distributed with respect to a Participant’s Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy the emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise by liquidation of the Participant’s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), and/or cancellation of deferrals pursuant to Section 6.5.3, provided the determination of such limitation is consistent with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii).
6.5.3    Cancellation of Deferral Elections. As provided by Section 2.12, in the event of a distribution under Section 6.5.1 the Plan Administrator will cancel the Participant’s deferral elections for the balance of the applicable Plan Year.
6.6    Designation of Beneficiaries.
6.6.1    Right to Designate or Revoke.
(a)    Each Participant may designate one or more primary Beneficiaries or secondary Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified part of such Participant’s vested Account in the event of such Participant’s death. If fewer than all designated primary or secondary Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, then the amount of such predeceased Beneficiary’s portion shall be allocated to the remaining primary or secondary Beneficiaries, as the case may be.
(b)    The Participant may change or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to or consent from any spouse, any person named as Beneficiary or any other person.
(c)    No such designation, change or revocation shall be effective unless completed and filed with the Plan Administrator in accordance with Plan Rules during the Participant’s lifetime.
25

6.6.2    Failure of Designation. If a Participant:
(a)    fails to designate a Beneficiary,
(b)    designates a Beneficiary and thereafter revokes such designation without naming another Beneficiary, or
(c)    designates one or more Beneficiaries and all such Beneficiaries so designated fail to survive the Participant, such Participant’s vested Account, shall be payable to the first class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries:
(d)    Participant’s surviving spouse Representative of Participant’s estate
6.6.3    Disclaimers by Beneficiaries. A Beneficiary entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of a deceased Participant’s vested Account may disclaim an interest therein subject to the Plan Rules.
6.6.4    Special Rules. Unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant’s Beneficiary designation, the following rules shall apply:
(a)    If there is not sufficient evidence that a person designated as a Beneficiary was living at the time of the death of the Participant, it shall be deemed that the Beneficiary was not living at the time of the death of the Participant.
(b)    The automatic Beneficiaries specified in Section 6.6.2 and the Beneficiaries designated by the Participant shall become fixed at the time of the Participant’s death (subject to Section 6.6.3) so that, if a Beneficiary survives the Participant but dies before the receipt of all payments due such Beneficiary hereunder, such remaining payments shall be payable to the representative of such Beneficiary’s estate.
(c)    If the Participant designates as a Beneficiary the person who is the Participant’s spouse on the date of the designation, either by name or by relationship, or both, the dissolution, annulment or other legal termination of the marriage between the Participant and such person shall automatically revoke such designation. The foregoing shall not prevent the Participant from designating a former spouse as a beneficiary on a form that is both executed by the Participant and received by the Plan Administrator (i) after the date of the legal termination of the marriage between the Participant and such former spouse and (ii) during the Participant’s lifetime.
(d)    A finalized marriage (other than a common law marriage) of a Participant subsequent to the date of filing of a Beneficiary designation shall revoke such designation unless the Participant’s new spouse had previously been designated as the Beneficiary.
(e)    Any designation of a nonspouse Beneficiary by name that is accompanied by a description of relationship to the Participant shall be given effect without regard to
26

whether the relationship to the Participant exists either then or at the Participant’s death.
(f)    Any designation of a Beneficiary only by statement of relationship to the Participant shall be effective only to designate the person or persons standing in such relationship to the Participant at the Participant’s death.
6.7    Facility of Payment.
6.7.1    Legal Disability. In case of the legal disability, including minority, of an individual entitled to receive any payment under this Plan, payment shall be made, if the Plan Administrator shall be advised of the existence of such condition:
(a)    to the duly appointed guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such individual, or
(b)    to a person or institution entrusted with the care or maintenance of the incompetent or disable Participant or Beneficiary, provided such person or institution has satisfied the Plan Administrator that the payment will be used for the best interest and assist in the care of such individual, and provided further, that no prior claim for said payment has been made by a duly appointed guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such individual.
6.7.2    Discharge of Liability. Any payment made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7 shall constitute a complete discharge of any liability or obligation of the Participating Employers under this Plan.
6.8    Tax Withholding. The Participating Employer (or any other person legally obligated to do so) shall withhold the amount of any federal, state or local income tax, payroll tax or other tax that the payer reasonably determines is required to be withheld under applicable law with respect to any amount payable under this Plan. All benefits otherwise due hereunder shall be reduced by the amount to be withheld.
6.9    Payments Upon Rehire. If a Participant who is receiving installment payments or due a deferred lump sum payment under this Plan is rehired, the payments will continue in accordance with the prior distribution elections.
6.10    Application for Distribution. A Participant may be required to make application to receive payment and to complete other forms and furnish other documentation required by the Plan Administrator. Distribution shall not be made to any Beneficiary until such Beneficiary shall have filed an application for benefits in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator and such application shall have been approved by the Plan Administrator and the Plan Administrator has determined that the applicant is entitled to payment.
6.11    Acceleration of Distributions. The Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion on behalf of the Company to accelerate the distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent allowed under Code section 409A.
27

6.12    Delay of Distributions. The Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion on behalf of the Company to delay the distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent allowed under Code section 409A, including, but not limited to, as necessary to maximize the Company’s tax deductions as allowed pursuant to Code section 162(m) or to avoid violation of federal securities or other applicable law.

7.1.2    Trust. Upon a Change-in-Control that causes the Plan to be terminated under Section 8.3.2, the trustee of the Trust will make distributions to Participants and Beneficiaries from the Trust in satisfaction of a Participating Employer’s obligations to make distributions under this Plan in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Trust to the extent such payments are not otherwise made directly by the Participating Employer.
7.2    Unfunded Obligation. The obligation of the Participating Employers to make payments under this Plan constitutes only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the Participating Employers to make such payments. Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims or interests in any specific property or assets of the Company or a Participating Employer, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company.
7.3    Establishment of Trust. The Participating Employers shall have no obligation to establish or maintain any fund, trust or account (other than a bookkeeping account or reserve) for the purpose of funding or paying the benefits promised under this Plan except as provided in the Trust. The Participating Employers may from time to time transfer to the Trust cash, or other marketable securities or other property acceptable to the trustee in accordance with the terms of the Trust. If the Participating Employers have deposited funds in the Trust, such funds shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Participating Employer that deposited such funds.
7.4    Spendthrift Provision. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.4, no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any Account which can be transferred nor shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any power to anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber the same while in the possession or control of the Participating Employers. The Plan Administrator shall not recognize any such effort to convey any interest under this Plan. No benefit payable under this Plan shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following judgment or other legal process before actual payment to such person.
7.4.1    Right to Designate Beneficiary. The power to designate Beneficiaries to receive the Account of a Participant in the event of such Participant’s death shall not permit or be construed to permit such power or right to be exercised by the Participant so as thereby to anticipate, pledge, mortgage or encumber such Participant’s Account or any part thereof, and any attempt of a Participant so to exercise said power in violation of this provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be disregarded by the Participating Employers.
29

7.4.2    Plan Administrator’s Right to Exercise Discretion. This Section 7.4 shall not prevent the Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable powers and options granted to it under any applicable provision hereof.
7.5    Compensation Recovery (Recoupment). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, a Participant who becomes subject to the Company’s recoupment policy as adopted by the Compensation & Human Capital Management Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors and amended from time to time (“Recoupment Policy”) may have all or a portion of his or her benefit under this Plan forfeited and/or all or a portion of any distributions payable to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary recovered by the Company.
7.5.1    Any Deferral Credit and related Earnings Credits resulting from the deferral of Eligible Compensation that is subject to recovery under the Recoupment Policy may be forfeited and, in such event, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the Participant’s Account balance.
7.5.2    If a Participant has commenced distributions and is subject to a claim for recovery under the Recoupment Policy, then the Company may, subject to any limitations under Code section 409A, retain all or any portion of the Participant’s (or his or her Beneficiary’s) taxable distribution, net of state, federal or foreign tax withholding, to satisfy such claim.

SECTION 8
ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

8.2    Amendment.
8.2.1    General Rule. The Company, by action of its Board of Directors, or by action of a person so authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors and subject to any limitations or conditions in such authorization, may at any time amend the Plan, in whole or in part, for any reason, including but not limited to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to terminate the Plan for future deferrals provided, however, that no amendment shall be effective to decrease the benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under the Plan to any Participant with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter accruing) prior to the date of such amendment. Written notice of any amendment shall be given each Participant then participating in the Plan.
8.2.2    Amendment to Benefit Leadership Team Member. Any amendment to the benefit of a Leadership Team Member under this Plan, to the extent approval of such amendment by the Board would be required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and its regulations or the rules of any applicable securities exchange, will require the approval of the Board.

8.3    Termination and Liquidation.
8.3.1    General Rule.
(a)    To the extent necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any time terminate and liquidate this Plan, provided such termination and liquidation satisfies the requirements of Code section 409A.
(b)    To the extent that a Participant’s benefit under the Plan will be immediately included in the income of the Participant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section 409A, the Board may terminate and liquidate this Plan, in whole or in part, as it relates to the impacted Participant.
8.3.2    Plan Termination and Liquidation on Account of a Change-in-Control. Upon a Change-in-Control, the Plan will terminate and payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if and to the extent provided in this Section 8.3.2.
(a)    The Plan will be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a Change-in-Control under Section 1.2.8, and (ii) a funding of the Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein as the “Plan termination
31

effective date”) unless, prior to such Plan termination effective date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan will not be terminated as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to have taken action to irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination effective date by its failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not terminate as of such date.
(b)    The determination by the Board under paragraph (a) constitutes a determination that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A, including an agreement by the Company that it will take such additional action or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to satisfy the requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below.
(c)    In the event the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as provided in paragraph (a), such termination shall be subject to either (i) or (ii), as follows:
(i)    If the Change-in-Control qualifies as a “change in control event” for purposes of Code section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and made in a lump sum as soon a administratively practicable but not more than 90 days following the Plan termination effective date, provided the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) have been satisfied.
(ii)    If the Change-in-Control does not qualify as a “change in control event” for purposes of Code section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and made in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable but not more than 60 days following the 12 month anniversary of the Plan termination effective date, provided the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C) have been satisfied.

APPENDIX A
SPP BENEFIT
A-1    Purpose and Application. The purpose of this Appendix A to this Plan Statement is to establish the rules for determining the amount of the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit under this Plan.
A-2    Background.
A-2.1    Transfer Credits. The Company has adopted and maintained several nonqualified supplemental pension plans to provide retirement income to a select group of highly compensated and key management employees in excess of the retirement income that can be provided under the Target Pension Plan on account of limitations imposed by the Code. Effective April 30, 2002, the Company began converting the accrued supplemental pension benefits of certain participants to credits under this Plan as adjusted annually to reflect changes in such benefits.
A-2.2    Cash Balance Formula. Effective January 1, 2003, the Target Pension Plan was amended to add a cash balance pension plan formula (referred to as the “personal pension account”). Depending on the date participation commences or an election was made, a Participant who has a benefit under the Target Pension Plan may have his or her accrued benefit under such plan based solely on the final average pay formula (the “traditional formula”), solely on the personal pension account, or a combination of the traditional formula (frozen as of December 31, 2002) and the personal pension account.
A-3    Definitions.
A-3.1    SPP I    “SPP I” means the Target Corporation SPP I.
A-3.2    SPP II    “SPP II” means the Target Corporation SPP II.
A-3.3    SPP III    “SPP III” means the Target Corporation SPP III.
A-4    SPP Benefit. Each Participant’s SPP Benefit is equal to the sum of the benefits under Section A-4.1, Section A-4.2 and Section A-4.3.
A-4.1    Traditional Formula Benefit. A Participant’s SPP Benefit is the excess, if any, of the monthly pension benefit under (a) over the monthly pension benefit under (b):
(a)    the monthly pension benefit the Participant would be entitled to under the Target     Pension Plan, based on the “traditional formula,” if such formula were applied
(i)    without regard to the maximum benefit limitation required by Code section 415;
(ii)    without regard to the maximum compensation limitation under Code section 401(a)(17);
(iii)    as if the definition of “certified earnings” under the Target Pension Plan for a plan year included compensation that would have been paid in the plan year in
A-1

the absence of the Participant’s election to defer payment of the compensation to a later date pursuant to the provisions of a deferred compensation plan;
(iv)    without regard to the alternative benefit formula of Sections 4.6(a)(3) and 4.6(b)(2) of the Target Pension Plan.
(b)    The monthly pension benefit the Participant is entitled to receive under the Target Pension Plan on account of the “traditional formula.”
A-4.2    Personal Pension Account. A Participant’s SPP Benefit includes the excess, if any, of the amount determined under (a) over the amount determined under (b):
(a)    The amount that would have been credited each quarter (including both “pay credits” and “interest credits”) to the Participant’s “personal pension account” under the Target Pension Plan, if such account were applied:
(i)    without regard to the maximum benefit limitations required by Code section 415;
(ii)    without regard to the maximum compensation limitation under Code     section 401(a)(17);
(iii)    as if the definition of “certified earnings” under the Target Pension Plan for a calendar quarter included compensation that would have been paid during such calendar quarter in the absence of the Participant’s election to defer payment of the compensation to a later date pursuant to the provisions of a deferred compensation plan;
(iv)    as if a distribution had been made from such account equal to any SPP Benefit Transfer Credits made under Section 3.3.
(b)    The amount of the credits actually made to the Participant’s “personal pension account” under the Target Pension Plan.
A-4.3    SPP III. SPP III benefits, which could have been included in a Participant’s SPP Benefit before SPP III was terminated effective January 1, 2016, were reflected in prior Plan Statements.
A-4.4    Company Determination. The actuarial lump sum present value of a Participant’s benefit determined under this Appendix A will be determined by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, by using such factors and assumptions as the Company considers appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion as of the date of distribution or transfer.
