2.4    Intended Tax Treatment. The parties hereto intend that each transfer of Contributed AHL Shares by AHL to each New AOG Subsidiary in exchange for Issued AOG Units described in Section 2.1(a) shall be treated as a contribution and exchange of such Contributed AHL Shares for an interest in the member of the Apollo Operating Group that owns such New AOG Subsidiary, which contribution and exchange is described in Section 721 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes (the “Intended Tax Treatment”).

(a)    AHL shall (i) as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the “Proxy Statement”) relating to a meeting of the shareholders of AHL for the purpose of seeking the Required Vote (the “AHL Shareholders Meeting”), (ii) respond as promptly

12


as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the staff of the SEC with respect to such filings, (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, prepare and file any amendments or supplements necessary to be filed in response to any such comments, (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the staff of the SEC and thereafter mail to its stockholders such Proxy Statement in final form as promptly as practicable, and (v) to the extent required by applicable Law, promptly file and mail to the AHL shareholders any supplement or amendment to such Proxy Statement. AHL shall promptly notify AGM upon the receipt of any comments (written or oral) from the SEC or its staff or any requests from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, shall consult with AGM and provide AGM with the opportunity to review and comment upon any response to such comments or requests prior to responding to any such comments or requests and shall reasonably consider AGM’s comments in good faith, and shall provide AGM promptly with copies of all correspondence between AHL and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. AGM shall cooperate with AHL in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing AHL, upon request, with any and all information as may be reasonably required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under the Exchange Act. AHL will provide AGM a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement, or any amendments or supplements thereto, prior to filing the same with the SEC, and shall reasonably consider AGM’s comments in good faith.
(b)    If, at any time prior to AHL Shareholders Meeting any information relating to AHL or AGM or any of their respective Affiliates should be discovered by AHL or AGM which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, AHL shall disseminate an appropriate amendment thereof or supplement thereto describing such information to AHL’s shareholders.
(c)    Subject to Section 5.4, the AHL Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement.
5.3    Shareholder Approval. AHL shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date on which the Proxy Statement has been declared effective by the SEC, duly call and give notice of and convene and hold the AHL Shareholders Meeting; provided, however, that AHL may postpone or adjourn the AHL Shareholders Meeting (a) with the prior written consent of AGM; (b) if a quorum has not been established for such AHL Shareholders Meeting; (c) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the board of directors of AHL has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the shareholders of AHL prior to the AHL Shareholders Meeting; (d) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional AHL shareholders, if and to the extent the Required Vote would not otherwise be obtained; or (e) if required by applicable Law; provided, however, that in the case of clause (b), (c), or (d), the AHL Shareholders Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned for more than twenty (20) Business Days from the originally scheduled date of the AHL Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of AGM. AHL shall postpone or adjourn the AHL Shareholders Meeting, if requested by AGM (in AGM’s sole discretion) to permit additional time to solicit the Required Vote, if sufficient proxies constituting the Required Vote have not been received by AHL. Each of AGM and AHL shall keep the other reasonably updated with respect to proxy solicitation results.  
5.4    No Adverse AHL Recommendation.
(a)    Except as set forth in Section 5.4(b), the board of directors of AHL or any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) shall not withdraw, suspend, modify or amend the AHL Recommendation in any manner adverse to AGM or fail to include the AHL Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (an “Adverse AHL Recommendation”).
(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors of AHL or the Special Committee may, at any time before obtaining the Required Vote, to the extent it determines by resolution in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under the Laws of Bermuda, make an Adverse AHL Recommendation, but only if:
(i)    AHL shall have first provided AGM prior written notice, at least five (5) Business Days in advance, that it intends to make such Adverse AHL Recommendation, which notice shall include reasonable detail regarding the reasons for such Adverse AHL Recommendation; and
(ii)    during the five (5) Business Days after the receipt of such notice, AHL shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its representatives to negotiate, with AGM in good faith (to the extent AGM desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that there is no longer a reasonable basis for such Adverse AHL Recommendation.
5.5    Securities Law Matters.
(a)    Legends. Each certificate evidencing securities issued hereunder and each certificate issued in exchange for or upon the transfer of any such securities, shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend (the “Legend”) in substantially the following form:


13


“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”), OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT OR AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER.
THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE HOLDER.”
In the event that any such securities are uncertificated, such securities shall be subject to a restrictive notation substantially similar to the Legend in the stock ledger or other appropriate records maintained by the issuer of such securities (the “Issuer”) or agent and the term “Legend” shall include such restrictive notation. The Issuer shall, and shall cause any transfer agent to, remove the Legend (or restrictive notation, as applicable) set forth above from the certificates evidencing any such securities (or the securities register or other appropriate records, in the case of uncertified securities), promptly upon request, at any time after the restrictions described in such Legend cease to be applicable, including, as applicable, when such securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, pursuant to an effective Registration Statement, and under this Agreement. The Issuer may reasonably request such opinions, certificates or other evidence that such restrictions no longer apply as a condition to removing the Legend.
(b)    Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC that may permit the sale of the AHL Common Shares to the public without registration, AHL agrees, so long as AGM and its Controlled Affiliates beneficially own equal to or greater than 7.5% of AHL’s Common Shares to (A) use its commercially reasonable efforts to make and keep public information regarding AHL available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required to be filed by AHL under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at, in each case, all times from and after the date hereof and (B) furnish, unless otherwise available at no charge by access electronically to the SEC’s EDGAR filing system, to AGM forthwith upon request (I) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of AHL, and (II) such other reports and documents of AHL so filed with the SEC as AGM may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing AGM to sell any such AHL Common Shares without registration.
(c)    Integration.
(i)    AHL shall not, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no Affiliate thereof shall, sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as defined in Section 2 of the Securities Act) that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Closing AHL Shares or Conditional Right Shares in a manner that would require the registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the Closing AHL Shares or Conditional Right Shares or that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Closing AHL Shares or Conditional Right Shares for purposes of the rules and regulations of the NYSE.
(ii)    AGM shall not, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no Affiliate thereof shall, sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as defined in Section 2 of the Securities Act) that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Issued AOG Units in a manner that would require the registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the Issued AOG Units or that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Issued AOG Units for purposes of the rules and regulations of the NYSE.
5.6    AHL Capital Structure. Contemporaneously with the Closing, AHL shall cause its bye-laws to be amended and restated in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the “Amended and Restated Bye-Laws”).
5.7    Conditional Right.
(a)    Terms. AHL hereby grants AGM, or its designee as set out below, a conditional right (the “Conditional Right”) to purchase up to that number of AHL Common Shares that would result in the Conditional Right Parties Shares, following the exercise of such Conditional Right, being equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the issued and outstanding AHL Common Shares (including in the denominator the maximum number of AHL Common Shares issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Convertible Securities) (the “Conditional Right Shares”), for a purchase price equal to the Conditional Right Price of the AHL Common Shares. AGM shall have the right to exercise the Conditional Right for one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, if at such time, the Conditional Right Parties Shares are equal to less than thirty-five percent (35%) of the issued and outstanding AHL Common Shares (including in the denominator the maximum number of AHL Common Shares issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Convertible Securities) as of such date. The Conditional Right may be exercised in whole or in part and on up to three (3) separate occasions. If not terminated earlier upon exercise, the Conditional Right shall automatically terminate on the date that is one hundred and eighty one (181) days after the Closing Date.
(b)    Exercise Procedures. To exercise the Conditional Right, AGM shall deliver a written notice of such exercise (the “Exercise Notice”) to AHL. The Exercise Notice shall indicate the number of AHL Common Shares that AGM is purchasing pursuant to the Conditional Right. As promptly as reasonably practicable, but not less than five (5) Business Days, following the delivery of the Exercise Notice to AHL (provided that such period shall be tolled to the extent necessary to obtain all required regulatory approvals), AHL and AGM shall effect the closing of the purchase indicated by the Exercise Notice. At such closing, (i) AGM shall pay or cause to be paid to AHL, by wire transfer to an account designated in writing to AGM by AHL for such purpose, an amount in U.S. dollars that is equal to the aggregate Conditional Right

14


Price in respect of the number of Conditional Right Shares indicated by the Exercise Notice, and (ii) AHL shall issue the Conditional Right Shares indicated in the Exercise Notice to one (1) or more Affiliates of AGM designated by AGM.
5.8    Closing Agreements. Concurrently with the Closing, AHL, AGM and each member of the Apollo Operating Group shall execute each of the Closing Agreements that this Agreement contemplates such parties will be a party to as of the Closing.
5.9    Tax Classification. Neither AGM nor any of its Affiliates shall file an election to treat any member of the Apollo Operating Group as other than a partnership for U.S. federal income (and applicable state and local) tax purposes or take any action or file an election to treat any New AOG Subsidiary as other than an entity disregarded as separate from the applicable member of the Apollo Operating Group from which it has received Issued AOG Units pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Agreement for U.S. federal income (and applicable state and local) tax purposes.
5.10    Tax Audits. AGM shall cause each member of the Apollo Operating Group to, and each such member shall, make an election pursuant to 6226 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law with respect to any material “imputed underpayment” (as defined in the Code) of any member of the Apollo Operating Group or any other material adjustment to the taxes of any member of the Apollo Operating Group by a Governmental Entity or any material penalties or interest incurred in connection with such adjustment, in each case with respect to taxable periods beginning prior to the Closing Date.
5.11    Tax Cooperation. AGM shall, upon AHL’s reasonable request and at AHL’s expense, cooperate with AHL and its Affiliates to structure the sale by AHL (or any Affiliate of AHL) of the Issued AOG Units pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement in a tax-efficient manner; provided, however that AGM shall not be required to agree to structure any sale by AHL (or any affiliate of AHL) in a manner that would be materially adverse to AGM, its Affiliates or any other holder of Operating Group Units (provided, that for these purposes, structuring any sale in a manner that would cause AGM to lose any step-up in tax basis of any assets owned by any member of the Apollo Operating Group attributable to any appreciation in value in such assets from the Closing Date will not be deemed to be materially adverse to AGM, but structuring any sale in a manner that could cause AGM to ultimately recognize any of the built in gain attributable to the built-in gain in the Contributed AHL Shares as of the time of their contribution to the Apollo Operating Group, will be deemed to be materially adverse to AGM). AGM shall (i) following the date hereof, cooperate in good faith with AHL and its advisors to identify any member of the Apollo Operating Group or any subsidiary thereof that (a) is reasonably likely to be treated as an entity that is fiscally opaque for U.K. tax purposes and (b) is reasonably likely to recognize a material amount of income which is treated as (or taxed as if) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States within the meaning of Section 882(a) of the Code (including pursuant to Section 897 of the Code) (any such entity, a “Relevant AOG Entity”) and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to complete such inquiry prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to convert or otherwise reorganize any Relevant AOG Entity into an entity that is treated as fiscally transparent for U.K. tax purposes; provided, however, that AGM shall not be required to convert any Relevant AOG Entity (A) that currently generates, or is expected to generate after the date of this Agreement, an immaterial amount of income, or (B) to the extent the conversion of such Relevant AOG Entity would result in material adverse tax, accounting, regulatory or other similar consequences to AGM, its Affiliates or any other holder of Operating Group Units. Without limitation of the foregoing, AGM shall use reasonable best efforts to convert or otherwise reorganize Apollo Insurance Solutions Group, LLC (“ISG”) and any direct or indirect owner of ISG that is a subsidiary of any member of the Apollo Operating Group that is fiscally opaque for U.K. tax purposes into an entity that is treated as fiscally transparent for U.K. tax purposes prior to the Closing Date. All out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by AGM in connection with conversion of Relevant AOG Entities pursuant to this provision shall be borne by AHL, and AHL shall promptly reimburse AGM for such costs and expenses upon AGM’s request.
5.12    Apollo Exchange Agreement. AGM agrees that, without the prior written consent of AHL not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, AGM shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, maintain the ratio of Operating Group Units to shares of AGM Common Stock in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions set forth in the Apollo Exchange Agreement as of the date hereof. Prior to amending or otherwise modifying the Apollo Exchange Agreement in a manner that would (or would be reasonably likely to) have a material adverse and material disproportionate effect on AHL and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (an “Adverse Amendment”), AGM shall notify AHL of its intent to make such Adverse Amendment. For a period of thirty (30) days following delivery of such notice, AGM shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, make such Adverse Amendment and, upon AHL’s request, AGM shall discuss in good faith the Adverse Amendment with AHL and shall make commercially reasonable efforts to amend or modify the Adverse Amendment such that it does not have a materially adverse and materially disproportionate effect on AHL and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.12 shall limit Section 3.1(b) of the Liquidity Agreement (the “Exchange MFN”) to the extent the Exchange MFN is applicable to the Adverse Amendment.
5.13    Ownership of AGM Capital Stock. AGM and each member of the Apollo Operating Group hereby agrees that, so long as AHL holds the Issued AOG Units, AGM shall not sell or otherwise transfer to any member of the Apollo Operating Group or their Subsidiaries, and shall not direct or facilitate the acquisition or holding by any member of the Apollo Operating Group or any of their Subsidiaries of, any capital stock of AGM, any other interest treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as capital stock of AGM or any option to acquire any such capital stock or other interest (including an option to acquire such an option, and each one of a series of such options); provided that, the foregoing shall not apply to transitory ownership by any member of the Apollo Operating Group as agent, nominee or custodian (A) for participants in an AGM shareholder-approved equity plan or (B) in connection with repurchases of capital stock of AGM issued pursuant to such an equity plan.
5.14    Class M Matters. AHL has delivered to AGM true and complete copies of the letter agreements executed by holders of a majority of each of the Class M-1, M-2, M-3 and M-4 Shares relating to, among other things, the voting of such shares at that AHL Shareholders Meeting (the “Class M Holder Letter Agreements”). AHL shall not agree to any amendment or modification to, or grant any waiver of, the voting

15


provision of the Class M Holder Letter Agreements by and among certain shareholders of AHL and AHL dated as of the date hereof (the “Class M Voting Agreement”). AHL shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fully enforce its rights under the Class M Holder Letter Agreements. AHL shall not issue any Class M-1, M-2, M-3 or M-4 Shares prior to the Required Vote having been obtained except such issuances as would not result in the Class M-1, M-2, M-3 or M-4 Shares subject to the Voting Agreements representing less than a majority of the aggregate voting power of any of the Class M-1, M-2, M-3 or M-4 Shares.

8.8    Equitable Remedies. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached.  It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other equitable remedies to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with respect to such remedy are hereby waived by each of the parties hereto.

3


Section 2.2    Apollo Lockup.  For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Lock-Up Period”) no Apollo Shareholder shall (a) directly or indirectly, Transfer any Class A Share to any Person other than to a Permitted Transferee as permitted under Section 2.1, or (b) enter into any Hedging Transaction.
Section 2.3    Additional Transfer Restrictions.  From and after the expiration of the Lock-Up Period (or prior to such expiration in connection with a Transfer to a Permitted Transferee pursuant to Section 2.1), no Apollo Shareholder shall directly or indirectly, Transfer any Class A Share to any Person that, (a) is a Competitor or (b) to the knowledge of such Apollo Shareholder, after reasonable inquiry (including, where practicable, obtaining a representation of the ownership of Class A Shares of such proposed transferee), would have a Percentage Interest in excess of two and one half of a percent (2.5%) after giving effect to such Transfer; provided, however, that the restrictions in this Section 2.3 shall not apply to any sale of any Class A Share on a national stock exchange or pursuant to a widely distributed underwritten public offering.
Section 2.4    Right of First Offer. Except for Transfers (x) to a Permitted Transferees pursuant to Section 2.1(a) or (y) that are registered under the Securities Act:
(a)    Right of First Offer.  If, following the Lock-Up Period, any Apollo Shareholder proposes to effect a Transfer (such Person proposing to effect such Transfer, the “ROFO Offeror” and such transaction, a “ROFO Transaction”) of all or any of its Class A Shares to any Person other than a Permitted Transferee (the “ROFO Purchaser”), then the ROFO Offeror shall give prior written notice to AHL of such Transfer (a “ROFO Notice”), which ROFO Notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Class A Shares proposed to be subject to Transfer by the ROFO Offeror.
(b)    Exercise of ROFO.
(i)    Within five (5) days after the delivery of the ROFO Notice to AHL (the “Initial ROFO Period”), AHL shall have the right and option, but not the obligation, to deliver a written notice offering to purchase the Class A Shares subject to such ROFO Notice (the “ROFO Offer Notice”), which ROFO Offer Notice shall set forth the material terms and conditions of the proposed ROFO Transaction (including (i) the proposed price per Class A Share and the form of consideration, if other than cash and (iii) the proposed terms and conditions of payment). If AHL delivers a ROFO Offer Notice in accordance with this Section 2.4(b) and the ROFO Offeror wishes to accept the offer in such ROFO Offer Notice, AHL and the ROFO Offeror shall negotiate in good faith to enter into definitive documentation with respect to such ROFO Transaction within five (5) days (the “ROFO Negotiation Period”) of the date of the ROFO Offer Notice.  If the ROFO Offer Notice is given to the ROFO Offeror but the ROFO Offeror does not wish to accept the offer in such ROFO Offer Notice or AHL (or its designated Affiliate(s)) and the ROFO Offeror fail to enter into definitive documentation with respect to the ROFO Transaction prior to the expiration of the ROFO Negotiation Period, the ROFO Offeror shall be permitted to enter into and consummate a ROFO Transaction with one or more transferees on terms and conditions substantially similar to (and in no event more favorable to the transferee than) the terms and conditions set forth in the ROFO Offer Notice, so long as the ROFO Offeror has complied with the other provisions of this Agreement.
(ii)    If a ROFO Notice is given to AHL, and during the Initial ROFO Period, AHL does not deliver a ROFO Offer Notice in accordance with this Section 2.4(b), the ROFO Offeror shall be free, upon the expiration of the Initial ROFO Period, to enter into and consummate a ROFO Transaction with one or more transferees, so long as the ROFO Offeror has complied with the other provisions of this Agreement.
(iii)    If, at the end of the ninety (90) day period following the end of the ROFO Negotiation Period (or, if no ROFO Offer Notice was delivered by AHL pursuant to this Section 2.4, the end of the Initial ROFO Period) with respect to a ROFO Notice delivered to AHL pursuant to this Section 2.4 that did not result in a transaction being consummated between AHL and the ROFO Offeror, the ROFO Offeror has not consummated the applicable ROFO Transaction, then such ROFO Transaction shall be deemed to have been abandoned and may only be completed if the procedures set forth in this Section 2.4 are followed again with respect to such ROFO Transaction.
(c)    ROFO Transaction Closing.  The closing (a “ROFO Closing”) of any Transfer by the ROFO Offeror to AHL or its designated Affiliates under this Section 2.4 (any such Transfer, an “Exercised ROFO Transaction”) shall take place on such date as is set forth in the definitive transaction agreement entered into between, on the one hand, the ROFO Offeror, and, on the other hand, AHL or such Affiliates (with respect to a particular Exercised ROFO Transaction under this Section 2.4, such date, the “ROFO Closing Date”).  At the ROFO Closing, (i) AHL or such Affiliates shall pay or cause to be paid to the ROFO Offeror the applicable purchase price in cash in immediately available funds (or other consideration as may be agreed by AHL or such Affiliate(s), on the one hand, and the ROFO Offeror, on the other hand) and (ii) (x) the ROFO Offeror shall Transfer the Class A Shares sold pursuant to such Exercised ROFO Transaction to AHL or such Affiliates and (y) the ROFO Offeror shall cease to hold the Class A Shares sold pursuant to such Exercised ROFO Transaction.
Section 2.5    Transfers and Joinders. If any Apollo Shareholder effects any Transfer of Class A Shares to a Permitted Transferee, such Apollo Shareholder shall, if such Permitted Transferee is not an Apollo Shareholder, prior to or concurrently with such Transfer, cause such Permitted Transferee to execute a joinder to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to AHL, in which such Permitted Transferee agrees to be an “Apollo Shareholder” for all purposes of this Agreement and which provides that such Permitted Transferee shall be bound by and shall fully comply with the terms of this Agreement that are applicable to Apollo Shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, such Apollo Shareholder shall not be relieved of any obligation or liability hereunder arising prior to the consummation of such Transfer.

4


Section 2.6    Binding Effect on Transferees. Subject to execution of a joinder to this Agreement prior to or concurrently with the applicable Transfer, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to AHL pursuant to Section 2.5, such Permitted Transferee shall become an Apollo Shareholder hereunder.
Section 2.7    Improper Transfer.  Any attempt to Transfer any Class A Shares other than in accordance with this Agreement shall be null and void and no right, title or interest in or to such Class A Shares shall be Transferred to the purported transferee, buyer, donee, assignee or encumbrance holder in connection with any attempted Transfer. AHL will not give, or permit its transfer agent to give, any effect to any such attempted Transfer on its records.
Section 2.8    Certain Transfers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit, restrict or impose any conditions on any Transfer of Class A Shares by any Fund or Portfolio Company, except to the extent that such Class A Shares were Transferred to such Fund or Portfolio Company by an Apollo Shareholder after the date hereof.

(a)    Until the Fall-away Date, AHL shall take all necessary actions so as to cause to be nominated for election to the Board of Directors at each annual or special general meeting at which the shareholders will vote on the election of directors, a number of individuals nominated by the Apollo Shareholders (which shall act for such purposes through the Apollo Representative) who meet all legal and regulatory requirements necessary to serve on the Board of Directors equal to (x) the Percentage Interest of the Apollo Shareholders multiplied by the total number of directorships comprising the Board of Directors (i.e., for the avoidance of doubt, including any vacancies and newly created directorships) and rounded up to the nearest whole number (for sake of clarity, the result of this calculation shall not equal less than zero and any number that is not a whole number shall be rounded to the next highest whole number) (each such Person nominated pursuant to this Section 3.1, an “Apollo Nominee”), minus (y) the number of Apollo Nominees then serving on classes of the Board of Directors whose terms are not expiring at such annual or special general meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of Apollo Nominees shall not equal or exceed a majority of the individuals nominated to serve on the Board of Directors unless the Percentage Interest of the Apollo Shareholders is greater than fifty percent (50%). For purposes of the nomination right set forth in this Section 3.1, the employees of or consultants to AGM and its Affiliates who are on the Board of Directors as of the date hereof (other than the Chief Executive Officer of the Company) shall be deemed to be Apollo Nominees.
(b)    Prior to the Fall-away Date, if any Apollo Nominee should resign from the Board of Directors or be rendered unable to serve on the Board of Directors by reason of death or disability or otherwise, then the Apollo Shareholders (which shall act for such purposes through the Apollo Representative) shall be entitled to nominate a replacement meeting all legal and regulatory requirements necessary to serve on the Board of Directors and AHL shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Board of Directors to cause such vacancy to be filled with such replacement Apollo Nominee; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, the Apollo Shareholders shall not have the right to nominate a new Apollo Nominee, and AHL shall not be required to take any action to cause any vacancy to be filled with any such new Apollo Nominee, to the extent that election of such new Apollo Nominee to the Board of Directors would result in a number of Apollo Nominees serving on the Board of Directors being in excess of the number of Apollo Nominees to which the Apollo Shareholders is then entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a). Any such nominated replacement who becomes a member of the Board of Directors shall be deemed to be an Apollo Nominee for all purposes under this Agreement.
(c)    AHL shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Board of Directors to recommend to AHL shareholders to vote in favor of the election of each Apollo Nominee, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit proxies or consents in favor of the Apollo Nominees to the same or greater extent as it does so in favor of the other persons nominated or recommended by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof), and (iii) reasonably cooperate with the Apollo Shareholders with respect to the Apollo Shareholders’ desired classification of the Apollo Nominees across the various classes of the Board of Directors.
(d)    The Apollo Shareholders’ right to nominate the Apollo Nominees is personal to the Apollo Shareholders and shall not be Transferrable to any other Person.
Section 3.2    Books and Records; Access.  Without derogating from any rights the Apollo Shareholders have under any other agreement or otherwise, until the Fall-away Date, AHL shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, permit the Apollo Shareholders and their respective designated representatives, upon reasonable prior notice to AHL: (a) to inspect, review or make copies and extracts during normal business hours from the books and records of AHL or any of such Subsidiaries and (b) once during any fiscal quarter to discuss the affairs, finances and condition of AHL or any of such Subsidiaries with the officers and public accountants of AHL or any such Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, AHL shall not be required to provide such portions of any materials pursuant to this Section 3.2 containing attorney-client, work product or similar privileged information of AHL or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other information required by AHL or any of its Subsidiaries to be kept confidential pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality agreement with a third Person or applicable Law, so long as AHL has used its commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an arrangement pursuant to which it may provide such information to the Apollo Shareholders without the loss of any such privilege or without violating such

5


confidentiality obligation. If the Apollo Shareholders exercise their rights pursuant to this Section 3.2, it shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Apollo Shareholders.
Section 3.3    Confidentiality.  Each Apollo Shareholder shall, and shall cause the Apollo Nominees to, keep confidential all Confidential Information; provided, that such Apollo Shareholder may, subject to and in compliance with applicable securities Laws, provide Confidential Information to any of its Affiliates or representatives to the extent reasonably necessary (and to the extent such Person reasonably needs to know such information) in connection with such Apollo Shareholder’s investment in AHL; provided, however, that such Apollo Shareholder shall cause any such recipient to agree to comply, and to comply, with the provisions of this Section 3.3, as well as Section 3.4, which are applicable to such Apollo Shareholder, it being understood that such Apollo Shareholder shall be responsible for any breach of the provisions hereof by such recipient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Apollo Shareholder, and any director, officer or employee of such Apollo Shareholder who receives Confidential Information (or any other Person who receives Confidential Information from such Apollo Shareholder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) may disclose any such Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Law; provided that, to the extent practicable and legally permissible, the disclosing party (a) gives AHL reasonable notice of any such requirement so that AHL may seek appropriate protective measures (at AHL’s sole cost and expense) and (b) to the extent requested in writing by AHL, reasonably cooperates with AHL (at AHL’s sole cost and expense) in attempting to obtain such protective measures.
Section 3.4    Securities Laws.  Each Apollo Shareholder acknowledges that it is aware, and will advise any of its Affiliates who receive Confidential Information pursuant to Section 3.1, Section 3.2 or otherwise, that applicable securities Laws prohibit any Person who has received material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities on the basis of such information or from communicating such information to any other Person unless in compliance with such Laws.
ARTICLE IV
CAPITAL SUPPORT FACILITY
Section 4.1    Capital Support Facility. AHL hereby grants the Apollo Representative, or its designees as set out below, a right (the “Facility Right”), exercisable on one or more occasions, to purchase up to that number of Class A Shares that would increase by five (5) percentage points the percentage of the issued and outstanding Class A Shares represented by the Conditional Right Parties Shares (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) (including in the denominator the maximum number of Class A Shares issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Convertible Securities and the Class A Shares issued pursuant to the Facility Right) as further described in this Section 4.1, for a purchase price equal to the higher of the Closing Price of the Class A Shares on the last trading day immediately prior to the applicable exercise of the Facility Right and (a) for the first year after the Closing, $42.92, and (b) thereafter, the 60 calendar day trailing VWAP of such Class A Shares as of the applicable exercise date of the Facility Right (the “Facility Price”). The Apollo Representative shall have the right to exercise the Facility Right at any time following the Closing. The Facility Right may be exercised in whole or in part, and on one or more occasion but, except to the extent that the exercise of a lesser percentage would result in the Facility Right being exercised in whole, each exercise will increase by no less than one (1) percentage point the percentage of the issued and outstanding Class A Shares as of such date of exercise represented by the Conditional Right Parties Shares (including in the denominator the maximum number of Class A Shares issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Convertible Securities and the Class A Shares issued pursuant to such exercise of the Facility Right). For illustrative purposes, if the Apollo Representative exercises the Facility Right to increase by one (1) percentage point the percentage of the issued and outstanding Class A Shares as of such date of exercise represented by the Conditional Right Parties Shares (including in the denominator the maximum number of Class A Shares issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Convertible Securities and the Class A Shares issued pursuant to such exercise of the Facility Right), then the Apollo Representative will continue to have the right to, at a later date, increase by four (4) percentage points the percentage of the issued and outstanding Class A Shares as of such later date of exercise represented by the Conditional Right Parties Shares (including in the denominator the maximum number of Class A Shares issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Convertible Securities and the Class A Shares issued pursuant to such later exercise of the Facility Right).
Section 4.2    Exercise Procedures. To exercise the Facility Right, the Apollo Representative shall deliver a written notice of such exercise (the “Exercise Notice”) to AHL. The Exercise Notice shall indicate the number of Class A Shares or percentage of Class A Shares as of such date of exercise (including in the denominator the maximum number of Class A Shares issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Convertible Securities and the Class A Shares issued pursuant to such exercise of the Facility Right) that the Apollo Representative, or its designees as set out below, is purchasing pursuant to the Facility Right (the “Facility Shares”). As promptly as reasonably practicable, but not less than five (5) Business Days following the delivery of an Exercise Notice to AHL (provided that such period shall be tolled to the extent necessary to obtain all required regulatory consents, authorizations and approvals, including those implicated for any Affiliates), AHL and the Apollo Representative shall effect the closing of the purchase indicated by the Exercise Notice (the “Facility Closing”). At the Facility Closing, (a) the Apollo Representative shall pay or cause to be paid to AHL, by wire transfer to an account designated in writing to the Apollo Representative by AHL for such purpose, an amount in U.S. dollars that is equal to the aggregate Facility Price in respect of the number of Facility Shares indicated by the Exercise Notice, and (b) AHL shall issue the Facility Shares indicated in the Exercise Notice to the Apollo Representative or one (1) or more Affiliates of the Apollo Representative designated by the Apollo Representative.
Section 4.3    AHL Action. AHL will use commercially reasonable efforts in accordance with applicable Law (including the rules of the New York Stock Exchange) to cause the Facility Closing to occur.

(i)    the offer and sale of the Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by the Requesting Shareholders for disposition in accordance with the intended method of disposition stated in such Demand;
(ii)    all other Registrable Securities which the Company has been requested to register pursuant to Section 2.1(b); and
(iii)    all equity securities of the Company which the Company may elect to register in connection with any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2.1;
all to the extent necessary to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended methods thereof) of the Registrable Securities and the additional Shares, if any, to be so registered.
(b)    Each Demand shall specify: (i) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered in such Demand Registration, (ii) the intended method of disposition in connection with such Demand Registration, if then known and (iii) the identity of the Requesting Shareholder (or Requesting Shareholders).

Subject to Section 2.1(h), the Company shall include in the Demand Registration covered by such Demand all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received a written request for inclusion therein within ten (10) days after the Company’s notice required by this paragraph has been mailed. Such written request shall comply with the requirements of a Demand as set forth in this Section 2.1(b).
(c)    Demand Registrations shall be on (i) if option (ii) and (iii) below are not available, Form S-1 or any similar long-form registration (“Long-Form Registration”), (ii) if option (iii) below is not available, Form S-3 or any similar short form registration, if such short form registration is then available to the Company, or (iii) Form S-3ASR if the Company is, at the time a Demand is made, a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer (a Demand Registration under each of clauses (ii) and (iii), a “Short-Form Registration”), in each case, in compliance with the Securities Act and in the form of registration statements that the Company has customarily prepared and filed with the SEC for issuances of its Shares. The Company shall not be required to effect more than two Long-Form Registrations per fiscal year.
(d)    Effective Demand Registration. A Demand Registration shall not be deemed to have been effected:
(i)    unless a registration statement with respect thereto has been declared effective by the SEC and remains effective in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act and the laws of any U.S. state or other jurisdiction applicable to the disposition of Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement until such time as all of such Registrable Securities shall have been disposed of in accordance with such registration statement or there shall cease to be any Registrable Securities;
(ii)    if, after it has become effective, such registration is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other Governmental Entities or court for any reason other than a violation of applicable law solely by any Selling Shareholder and has not thereafter become effective;
(iii)    if, in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the conditions to closing specified in an underwriting agreement applicable to the Company are not satisfied or waived other than by reason of any breach or failure by any Selling Shareholder; or
(iv)    if the Company effects a postponement, declares a Suspension Period or similarly delays the exercise of rights under this Agreement pursuant to the terms in the paragraph below or the terms of this Agreement generally.

4


Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to (i) maintain the effectiveness of a Long-Form Registration, filed pursuant to a Demand Registration, for a period longer than 75 days or (ii) effect any Demand Registration (A) within six (6) months of the effective date of a registration statement with respect to a “firm commitment” Underwritten Offering in which all Piggyback Sellers were given “piggyback” rights pursuant to Section 2.2 (and at least 50% of the number of Registrable Securities requested by such Piggyback Sellers to be included in such Demand Registration were included), (B) within three (3) months of the effective date of a registration statement with respect to any other Demand Registration, (C) within 90 days from the date on which a Marketed Underwritten Offering was priced or (D) if, in the reasonable judgment of the Board, it is not feasible for the Company to proceed with the Demand Registration because of the unavailability of audited or other required financial statements or financial information, provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such financial statements or financial information as promptly as practicable. In addition, the Company shall be entitled to postpone (upon written notice to all Shareholders) the filing or the effectiveness of a registration statement for any Demand Registration (but no more than twice in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months and in no event for more than an aggregate of one-hundred twenty (120) days in any three-hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive day period) if the Board determines in its reasonable judgment that the filing or effectiveness of the registration statement relating to such Demand Registration would cause the disclosure of material, non-public information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential, provided, however, that such postponement shall terminate at such time that such information is no longer material, non-public information or the Company no longer has a bona fide business purpose for preserving such information as confidential.
(e)    Offering Requests.
(i)    Requests for Marketed Underwritten Offerings. A Requesting Shareholder may from time to time request to sell Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering that is registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or under a Demand Registration that includes roadshow presentations or investor calls by management of the Company or other marketing efforts by the Company (a “Marketed Underwritten Offering”); provided that in the case of each such Marketed Underwritten Offering the Registrable Securities proposed to be sold shall have an expected aggregate offering price of at least $40 million; and provided, further, that the Company shall not be required to effect (A) a Marketed Underwritten Offering if another Marketed Underwritten Offering has been effected and priced within 90 days or (B) more than four Marketed Underwritten Offerings within any 12-month period. Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Section 2.1, unless otherwise agreed to by the Requesting Shareholders, no other Shareholder shall have the right to participate in a Marketed Underwritten Offering.
(ii)    Requests for Non-Marketed Underwritten Offerings. Requesting Shareholders may from time to time request to sell Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering that is registered under the Shelf Registration Statement or under a Demand Registration that does not include any marketing efforts by the Company or its management, including a “block trade” (a “Non-Marketed Underwritten Offering”); provided that in the case of each such Non-Marketed Underwritten Offering the Registrable Securities proposed to be sold shall have an aggregate offering price of at least $5 million. Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Section 2.1, unless otherwise agreed to by the Requesting Shareholders, no other Shareholder shall have the right to participate in a Non-Marketed Underwritten Offering.
(iii)    Requests for Non-Underwritten Offerings. At any time that a Shelf Registration Statement or any shelf registration statement filed in connection with a Demand Registration shall be effective with respect to Registrable Securities of a Requesting Shareholder and such Requesting Shareholder desires to initiate an offering or sale of all or part of such Requesting Shareholder’s Registrable Securities that does not constitute an Underwritten Offering (a “Non-Underwritten Shelf Takedown”), such Requesting Shareholder shall so indicate in a written request delivered to the Company no later than three Business Days prior to the expected date of such Non-Underwritten Shelf Takedown, which request shall include (i) the type and total number of Registrable Securities expected to be offered and sold in such Non-Underwritten Shelf Takedown and (ii) the expected plan of distribution of such Non-Underwritten Shelf Takedown. Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Section 2.1, unless otherwise agreed to by the Requesting Shareholder, no other Shareholder shall have the right to participate in a Non-Underwritten Shelf Takedown.
(iv)    Underwritten Offering Notices. All requests for Underwritten Offerings shall be made by giving written notice to the Company (an “Underwritten Offering Notice”). Each Underwritten Offering Notice shall specify (i) the approximate number of Registrable Securities to be sold in the Underwritten Offering, (ii) whether such offering will be a Marketed Underwritten Offering or a Non-Marketed Underwritten Offering, and (iii) the intended marketing efforts, if any. Within five Business Days after receipt of any Offering Notice, if agreed to by the Requesting Shareholders in accordance with the provisions set forth above, the Company shall (A) send written notice of such requested Offering to all other Shareholders, if any, and shall include in such Offering all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within ten (10) days after mailing such notice or (B) follow such other procedure agreed to by the Requesting Shareholders with respect to allowing other Shareholders to participate in the Underwritten Offering.
(f)    Any time that a Demand Registration involves an Underwritten Offering, (i) the Shareholders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in the Demand Registration shall select the investment banker or investment bankers and managers that will serve as lead and co-managing underwriters with respect to the offering of such Registrable Securities, subject to the consent of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) the Company and the Selling Shareholders shall enter into an underwriting agreement that is reasonably acceptable to the Shareholders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in the Demand Registration with respect to the provisions affecting such Shareholders and which agreement shall contain representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company customarily included (but not inconsistent with the covenants and

5


agreements of the Company contained herein) by an issuer of common stock in underwriting agreements with respect to offerings of common stock for the account of, or on behalf of, such issuers.
(g)    The Company shall not include any securities other than Registrable Securities in a Demand Registration, except with the written consent of the Requesting Shareholders participating in such Demand Registration holding a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such Demand Registration. If, in connection with a Demand Registration, the lead bookrunning underwriters (or, if such Demand Registration is not an Underwritten Offering, a nationally recognized independent investment bank selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Shareholders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such Demand Registration, and whose fees and expenses (other than any underwriting discounts relating to such Registrable Securities sold in such Demand Registration) shall be borne solely by the Company) advise the Company, in writing, that, in their reasonable opinion, the inclusion of all of the securities, including securities of the Company that are not Registrable Securities, sought to be registered in connection with such Demand Registration would adversely affect the marketability of the Registrable Securities sought to be sold pursuant thereto, then the Company shall include in such registration statement only such securities as the Company is reasonably advised by such underwriters or investment bank can be sold without such adverse effect as follows and in the following order of priority: (i) first, up to the number of Shares requested to be included in such Demand Registration by any Shareholders, which, in the opinion of the underwriter or investment bank can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, pro rata among such Shareholders based upon the number of Shares deemed to be owned by such Persons; (ii) second, securities the Company proposes to sell for its own account; and (iii) third, all other equity securities of the Company duly requested to be included in such registration statement by any other shareholders holding pari passu registration rights, pro rata on the basis of the amount of such other securities requested to be included or such other method determined by the Company.
Section 2.2    Piggyback Registration.
(a)    Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, whenever the Company proposes to register the offer and sale of any of its equity securities under the Securities Act (other than a registration by the Company on a registration statement on Form S-4 or a registration statement on Form S-8 or any successor forms thereto) (a “Piggyback Registration”), whether for its own account or for the account of others, the Company shall give each Shareholder prompt written notice thereof (but not less than ten (10) business days prior to the public filing by the Company with the SEC of any registration statement with respect thereto, provided that the Company shall not be required to deliver such notice prior to the a confidential submission or non-public filing of any registration statement with the SEC). Such notice (a “Piggyback Notice”) shall specify, at a minimum, the number of equity securities proposed to be registered, the proposed date of filing of such registration statement with the SEC, the proposed means of distribution, the proposed managing underwriter or underwriters (if any and if known) and a reasonable estimate by the Company of the proposed minimum offering price of such equity securities. Upon the written request of any Person that on the date of the Piggyback Notice is a Shareholder (a “Piggyback Seller”) (which written request shall specify the number of Registrable Securities then presently intended to be disposed of by such Piggyback Seller, and may condition the sale of such Registrable Securities on a price range) given within ten (10) days after such Piggyback Notice is received by such Piggyback Seller, the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities held by Piggyback Sellers with respect to which the Company has received such written requests for inclusion to be included in such Piggyback Registration on the same terms and conditions as the Company’s equity securities being sold in such Piggyback Registration (whether for the account of the Company or for the account of others).
(b)    If, in connection with a Piggyback Registration, any managing underwriter (or, if such Piggyback Registration is not an Underwritten Offering, a nationally recognized independent investment bank selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Shareholders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such Piggyback Registration, and whose fees and expenses shall be borne solely by the Company) advises the Company in writing that, in its opinion, the inclusion of all the equity securities sought to be included in such Piggyback Registration by (i) the Company, (ii) others who acquire Shares after the date hereof and whom the Company gives registration rights and have sought to have all or part of such Shares registered in such Piggyback Registration pursuant to such registration rights, (iii) others with the written consent of Shareholders participating in such Demand Registration holding a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such Demand Registration (such Persons referenced in clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 2.2(b) being “Other Demanding Sellers”), and (iv) the Piggyback Sellers, as the case may be, would adversely affect the marketability of the equity securities sought to be sold pursuant thereto, then the Company shall include in the registration statement applicable to such Piggyback Registration only such equity securities as the Company is so advised by such underwriter can be sold without such an effect, as follows and in the following order of priority:
(i)    if the Piggyback Registration relates to an offering for the Company’s own account, then (A) first, such number of equity securities to be sold by the Company for its own account, and (B) second, Shares requested to be included in such Piggyback Registration by any Other Demanding Sellers and any Piggyback Sellers, pro rata among such Other Demanding Sellers and Piggyback Sellers based upon the number of Shares deemed to be beneficially owned by such Persons; or
(ii)    if the Piggyback Registration relates to an offering other than for the Company’s own account, then (A) first, Shares requested to be included in such Piggyback Registration by any Other Demanding Sellers and any Piggyback Sellers, pro rata among such Other Demanding Sellers and Piggyback Sellers based upon the number of Shares deemed to be owned by such Persons, and (B) second, the other equity securities of the Company proposed to be sold by the Company as determined by the Company.

6


(c)    In connection with any Underwritten Offering under this Section 2.2, the Company shall not be required to include the Registrable Securities of a Shareholder in the Underwritten Offering unless such Shareholder accepts the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and the underwriters, or, if applicable, the underwriters selected by the Shareholders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in the Demand Registration in accordance with the terms of hereof.
(d)    If, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register the offer and sale of any of its equity securities as set forth in this Section 2.2 and prior to the time the registration statement filed in connection with such Piggyback Registration is declared effective, the Company shall determine, at its election, for any reason not to register the offer and sale of such equity securities, the Company shall give written notice of such determination to each Shareholder within five (5) days thereof and thereupon shall be relieved of its obligation to register the offer and sale of any Registrable Securities in connection with such particular withdrawn or abandoned Piggyback Registration (but not from its obligation to pay the Registration Expenses in connection therewith as provided herein); provided, that Shareholders may continue the registration as a Demand Registration pursuant to the terms of Section 2.1.
Section 2.3    Shelf Registration.
(a)    Subject to Section 2.3(d), and further subject to the availability of a registration statement on Form S-3 or on any other form which permits incorporation of information by reference to other documents filed by the issuer with the SEC (“Form S-3”) to the Company, any of the Shareholders may by written notice delivered to the Company (the “Shelf Notice”) require the Company to file as soon as practicable (but no later than sixty (60) days after the date the Shelf Notice is delivered), and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable and within ninety (90) days after such filing date, a Form S-3 providing for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of a number of Registrable Securities that is equal to or greater than the Registrable Amount (based on the number of Registrable Securities outstanding on the date such notice is delivered) owned by such Shareholders and any other Shareholders who elect to participate therein as provided in Section 2.3(b) in accordance with the plan and method of distribution set forth in the prospectus included in such Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”).
(b)    Within five (5) business days after receipt of a Shelf Notice pursuant to Section 2.3, the Company will deliver written notice thereof to each Shareholder. Each Piggyback Seller may elect to participate in the Shelf Registration Statement by delivering to the Company a written request to so participate within ten (10) days after the Shelf Notice is received by any such Piggyback Seller.
(c)    Subject to Section 2.3(d), the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective (including through updates, amendments, replacements or otherwise) until the date on which all Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold thereunder in accordance with the plan and method of distribution disclosed in the prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement, or otherwise. If the Company becomes ineligible to use Form S-3 for secondary sales, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file a Form S-1 shelf as promptly as practicable to replace the Shelf Registration Statement that is a Form S-3 shelf (but in no event more than 20 Business Days after the date of such ineligibility) and have the Form S-1 shelf declared effective as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 90 days after the date of such filing) (at which time the Shelf Registration Statement shall refer to such Form S-1, and, in the event the Company again becomes eligible to use Form S-3 for secondary sales, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to convert the Form S-1 shelf into a Form S-3 shelf).
(d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to suspend the use of the prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement, filed in accordance with Section 2.3, for a reasonable period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days in succession or one-hundred eighty (180) days in the aggregate in any twelve (12) month period (a “Suspension Period”, provided, however, that any Suspension Period shall terminate at such time as the conditions which gave rise to the Suspension Period have ceased) if the Board shall determine in its reasonable judgment that (A) it is not feasible for the Shareholder to use the prospectus for the sale of Registrable Securities because of the unavailability of audited or other required financial statements or financial information, provided that the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain such financial statements as promptly as practicable, or (B) the filing or effectiveness of the prospectus relating to the Shelf Registration Statement would cause the disclosure of material, non-public information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential. After the expiration of any Suspension Period and without any further request from a Shareholder, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare a post-effective amendment or supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement or the prospectus, or any document incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable Securities included therein, the prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(e)    The Shareholders shall be entitled to demand such number of shelf registrations as shall be necessary to sell all of its Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2.3.

Section 2.4    Withdrawal Rights.
Any Shareholder having notified or directed the Company to include any or all of its Registrable Securities in a registration statement under the Securities Act shall have the right to withdraw any such notice or direction with respect to any or all of the Registrable Securities designated by it for registration by giving written notice to such effect to the Company prior to the effective date of such registration statement. In the event of any such withdrawal, the Company shall not include such Registrable Securities in the applicable registration and such Registrable Securities shall continue to be Registrable Securities for all purposes of this Agreement. No such withdrawal shall affect the obligations of the Company with respect to the Registrable Securities not so withdrawn; provided, however, that in the case of a Demand Registration, if such withdrawal shall reduce the number of Registrable Securities sought to be included in such registration below the Registrable Amount, then the Company shall as promptly as practicable give each Shareholder seeking to register Registrable Securities notice to such effect and, within ten (10) days following the mailing of such notice, such Shareholders still seeking registration shall, by written notice to the Company, elect to register additional Registrable Securities to satisfy the Registrable Amount or elect that such registration statement not be filed or, if theretofore filed, be withdrawn. During such 10-day period, the Company shall not file such registration statement if not theretofore filed or, if such registration statement has been theretofore filed, the Company shall not seek, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent, the effectiveness thereof. If a Shareholder more than once in any year withdraws its notification or direction to the Company to include Registrable Securities in a registration statement in accordance with this Section 2.4 with respect to a sufficient number of shares so as to reduce the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration statement below the Registrable Amount (and Shareholders do not elect to register additional Registrable Securities to satisfy the Registrable Amount), such Shareholder shall be required to promptly reimburse the Company for all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with preparing for the registration of such Registrable Securities.
Section 2.5    Holdback Agreements.
(a)    In the case of any Underwritten Offering in connection with a Demand or Shelf Registration pursuant to this Agreement, each Requesting Shareholder, and in the case of any Piggyback Registration pursuant to this Agreement, each participating Shareholder, agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution (including sales pursuant to Rule 144) of equity securities of the Company, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such equity securities, during any time period reasonably requested by the managing underwriter(s) of such Underwritten Offering (which shall not exceed seventy-five (75) days) with respect to any Demand, Shelf or Piggyback Registration (in each case, except as part of such registration subject to customary exceptions to be agreed). Each Shareholder subject to the restrictions of the first sentence of Section 2.5 shall receive the benefit of any shorter “lock-up” period or permitted exceptions agreed to by the managing underwriter(s) for any Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Agreement irrespective of whether such Shareholder participated in the Underwritten Offering and the terms of such lock-up agreements shall govern such Shareholders in lieu of the first sentence of Section 2.5.
(b)    In the case of any Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause other Shareholders (other than the Shareholders) and its directors and officers to execute any lock-up agreements in form and substance as agreed by the Shareholders and as reasonably requested by the managing underwriters; provided, that the Holder agrees to cause the directors of the Company then employed by the Holder to execute any such lock-up agreements.
(c)    In the case of any Underwritten Offering, the Company agrees not to effect any Public Offering or distribution of any equity securities of the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for equity securities of the Company for a period (a) commencing upon the earlier of (x) the commencement of the roadshow in respect of such offering and(y) seven days prior to the pricing of such offering and (b) ending 90 days after the pricing of such offering, except, in each case, as part of such Underwritten Offering.
Section 2.6    Registration Procedures.
(a)    If and whenever the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act as provided in Section 2.1, Section 2.2, and Section 2.3 the Company shall as expeditiously as reasonably possible:
(i)    prepare and file with the SEC (subject to the provisions of Section 2.3 with respect to Shelf Registrations, promptly and, in any event on or before the date that is (i) 90 days, in the case of any Long-Form Registration, after the receipt by the Company a Demand from a Requesting Shareholder or (ii) 45 days, in the case of any Short-Form Registration, after the receipt by the Company of a Demand from a Requesting Shareholder) the requisite registration statement to effect any such registration and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC and remain effective pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and cause such registration statement to contain a “Plan of Distribution” that permits the distribution of securities pursuant to all legal means; provided, however, that the Company may discontinue any registration of its securities which are not Registrable Securities at any time prior to the effective date of the registration statement relating thereto; provided, further that before filing such registration statement, prospectus or any amendments thereto, the Company will furnish to the counsel selected by the Shareholders which are including Registrable Securities in such registration copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be subject to the review of such counsel, and such review to be conducted with reasonable promptness;

(v)    use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed and, if no such securities are so listed, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market;

(viii)    promptly make available for inspection by a representative of the Selling Shareholders, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to any registration statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent or representative retained by the Selling Shareholders (collectively and not individually) or underwriter (collectively, the “Inspectors”), all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company (collectively, the “Records”), as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility in connection with such registration statement, and cause the Company’s officers, directors and employees to supply all information requested by any such Inspector in connection with such registration statement; provided, however, that, unless the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in the registration statement or the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be required to provide any information under this subparagraph (viii) if (i) the Company believes, after consultation with counsel for the Company, that to do so would cause the Company to forfeit an attorney-client privilege that was applicable to such information or (ii) if either (A) the Company has requested and been granted from the SEC confidential treatment of such information contained in any filing with the SEC or documents provided supplementally or otherwise or (B) the Company reasonably determines that such Records are confidential and so notifies the Inspectors in writing unless prior to furnishing any such information with respect to (i) or (ii) such Selling Shareholder requesting such information agrees, and causes each of its Inspectors, to enter into a confidentiality agreement on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company; and provided, further, that each Selling Shareholder agrees that it will, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action and to prevent disclosure of the Records deemed confidential;

Section 2.8    Registration Indemnification.
(a)    By the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Selling Shareholder and each of their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, managers, partners and agents and each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such Selling Shareholder or such other Person indemnified under this Section 2.8(a) from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, whether joint or several (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) (collectively, the “Losses”), to which they are or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or

11


other U.S. federal or state statutory law (including any applicable “blue sky” laws), rule or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such Losses arise out of, are based upon, are caused by or relate to any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus, offering circular, offering memorandum or Disclosure Package (including the Free Writing Prospectus) or any amendment or supplement thereto or any filing or document incidental to such registration or qualification of the securities as required by this Agreement, or any omission (or alleged omission) of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except that no Person indemnified shall be indemnified hereunder insofar as the same are made in conformity with and in reliance on information furnished in writing to the Company by such Person concerning such Person expressly for use therein. Such indemnification obligation shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have to any such indemnified person. In connection with an Underwritten Offering and without limiting any of the Company’s other obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall also indemnify such underwriters, their officers, directors, employees and agents and each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such underwriters or such other Person indemnified under this Section 2.8(a) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification (and exceptions thereto) of Selling Shareholders. Reimbursements payable pursuant to the indemnification contemplated by this Section 2.8(a) will be made by periodic payments during the course of any investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses incurred.
(b)    By the Selling Shareholders. In connection with any registration statement in which a Shareholder is participating, each such Selling Shareholder will furnish to the Company in writing information regarding such Person’s ownership of Registrable Securities and its intended method of distribution thereof and, to the extent permitted by law, shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify the Company, its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents and each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company or such other Person indemnified under this Section 2.8(b) against all Losses caused by any untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is furnished in writing by such Person concerning such Person expressly for use therein; provided, however, that each Selling Shareholder’s obligation to indemnify the Company hereunder shall, to the extent more than one Person is subject to the same indemnification obligation, be apportioned between each Person based upon the net amount received by each Person from the sale of Registrable Securities, as compared to the total net amount received by all of the indemnifying Persons pursuant to such registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person shall be liable to the Company and the underwriters for aggregate amounts in excess of the lesser of (i) such apportionment and (ii) the net amount received by such holder in the offering giving rise to such liability.
(c)    Notice. Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligation, except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced by such failure to provide such notice on a timely basis.
(d)    Defense of Actions. In any case in which any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not (so long as it shall continue to have the right to defend, contest, litigate and settle the matter in question in accordance with this paragraph) be liable to such indemnified party hereunder for any legal or other expense subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, supervision and monitoring (unless (i) such indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on the grounds that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to the defenses available to such indemnifying party, (ii) counsel to the indemnifying party has informed the indemnifying party that the joint representation of the indemnifying party and one or more indemnified parties could be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed within a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and the indemnified party is or is reasonably likely to be prejudiced by such delay, in any such event the indemnified party shall be promptly reimbursed by the indemnifying party for the expenses incurred in connection with retaining separate legal counsel). An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of an action or claim effected without its consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). The indemnifying party shall lose its right to defend, contest, litigate and settle a matter if it shall fail to diligently contest such matter (except to the extent settled in accordance with the next following sentence). No matter shall be settled by an indemnifying party without the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, it being understood that the indemnified party shall not be deemed to be unreasonable in withholding its consent if the proposed settlement imposes any obligation on the indemnified party).
(e)    Survival. The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified Person and will survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities and the termination of this Agreement.
(f)    Contribution. If recovery is not available or is insufficient under the foregoing indemnification provisions for any reason or reasons other than as specified therein, in each case as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, any Person who would otherwise be entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall nevertheless be entitled to contribution with respect to any Losses with respect to which such Person would be entitled to such indemnification but for such reason or reasons. In determining the amount of contribution to which the respective Persons are entitled, there shall be considered the Persons’ relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or

12


omission, and other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. It is hereby agreed that it would not necessarily be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 2.8(f). No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Selling Shareholder or transferee thereof shall be required to make a contribution in excess of the net amount received by such holder from its sale of Registrable Securities in connection with the offering that gave rise to the contribution obligation.
Section 2.9    Request for Information; Certain Rights.
(a)    Request for Information. Not less than five (5) business days before the expected filing (or confidential submission, if applicable) date of each registration statement pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall notify each Shareholder who has timely provided the requisite notice hereunder entitling the Shareholder to include for registration Registrable Securities in such registration statement of the information, documents and instruments from such Shareholder that the Company or any underwriter reasonably requests in connection with such registration statement, including, but not limited to a questionnaire, custody agreement, power of attorney, form of lock-up letter and form of underwriting agreement (the “Requested Information”). Such Shareholder shall promptly return the Requested Information to the Company. If the Company has not received the Requested Information (or a written assurance from such Shareholder that the Requested Information that cannot practicably be provided prior to filing of the registration statement will be provided in a timely fashion) from such Shareholder within a reasonable period of time (as determined by the Company) prior to the filing (or confidential submission, if applicable) of the applicable registration statement, the Company may file such registration statement without including Registrable Securities of such Shareholder, provided that the Company shall include such Registrable Securities upon receipt of such Requested Information. The failure to so include in any registration statement the Registrable Securities of a Shareholder (with regard to that registration statement) shall not in and of itself result in any liability on the part of the Company to such Shareholder.
(b)    No Grant of Future Registration Rights. The Company shall not grant any shelf, demand, piggyback or incidental registration rights that are senior to or otherwise conflict with the rights granted to the Shareholders hereunder to any other Person without the prior written consent of Shareholders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities held by all Shareholders.
(c)    Alternative Markets. In the event that a trading market for the Company’s Shares develops that does not require that the Shares be registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act (e.g. outside the United States or through a Rule 144A trading market), the Company agrees to provide alternative liquidity provisions to the Shareholders that would be the functional equivalent of this Article II, including the provision of offering documents, the entering into of placement and/or listing agreements and the functional equivalent of the other terms of this Article II and with the functional equivalent of the division of liabilities and expenses as provided in this Article II.
(d)    Adjustments Affecting Registrable Shares. Without the written consent of each Shareholder, the Company shall not effect or permit to occur any combination, subdivision or reclassification of Registrable Shares that would materially adversely affect the ability of the Shareholders to include such Registrable Shares in any registration of securities under the Securities Act contemplated by this Agreement or the marketability of such Registrable Shares under any such registration or other offering.
(e)    Rule 144. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to enable Shareholders to sell Registrable Shares without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time or (b) any similar rules or regulations adopted by the Commission, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, filing on a timely basis all reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act. Upon the written request of any Shareholder, the Company shall deliver to such Shareholder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

SHARES
2.
Power to Issue Shares
2.1
Subject to these Bye-laws and to any Resolution to the contrary and without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any existing shares or class of shares, the Board shall have the power and authority to the fullest extent permitted under the Act, but subject to all contractual restrictions to which the Company is bound, to issue any unissued shares on such terms and conditions as it may determine and any shares or class of shares may be issued with such preferred, deferred or other special rights or such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital, or otherwise as the Board may by resolution prescribe, and to fix or alter the number of shares comprising any such class or series.
2.2
The authority of the Board with respect to each such class or series shall include, without any limitation of the foregoing, the right to determine and fix the following preferences and powers, which may vary as between different classes or series of shares:
(a)
the distinctive designation of such class or series and the number of shares to constitute such class or series;
(b)
the rate at which any dividends on the shares of such class or series shall be declared and paid, or set aside for payment, whether dividends at the rate so determined shall be cumulative or accruing, and whether the shares of such class or series shall be entitled to any participating or other dividends in addition to dividends at the rate so determined, and if so, on what terms;
(c)
the right or obligation, if any, of the Company to redeem shares of the particular class or series and, if redeemable, the price, terms and manner of such redemption;
(d)
the special and relative rights and preferences, if any, and the amount or amounts per share, which the shares of such class or series shall be entitled to receive upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company;
(e)
the terms and conditions, if any, upon which shares of such class or series shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock of any other class or series, including the price or prices or the rate or rates of conversion or exchange and the terms of adjustment, if any;

limitations, if any, on the issuance of additional shares of such class or series or any shares of any other class or series.
2.3
Subject to the Act, any preference shares may be issued or converted into shares that (at a determinable date or at the option of the Company or the holder) are liable to be redeemed on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by the Board (before the issue or conversion).
3.
Power of the Company to Purchase its Shares
3.1
The Company may purchase its own shares for cancellation or acquire them as Treasury Shares in accordance with the Act on such terms as the Board shall think fit.
3.2
The Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to purchase or acquire all or any part of its own shares in accordance with the Act.
4.
Rights Attaching to Shares
4.1
Subject to any Resolution to the contrary (and without prejudice to any special rights conferred thereby on the holders of any other shares or class of shares), the common share capital of the Company shall consist of a single class of common




shares designated as Class A Common Shares (the “Class A Common Shares”). In accordance with Bye-law 2.2, the Board may authorize the creation and issuance of one or more series of preference shares.
4.2
The Class A Common Shares shall collectively represent 100% of the Total Voting Power, and subject to the provisions of Bye-law 4.3, each Class A Common Share shall be entitled to one vote.
4.3    
(a)
The voting rights of the Class A Common Shares shall, until the Restriction Termination Date, be subject to the provisions of this Bye-law 4.3(a); provided, that this Bye-law 4.3(a) shall not apply at any time that the number and relationships of the Company’s Shareholders would make it impossible to fully reallocate (pursuant to Bye-law 4.3(a)(iii)) all the vote that would be reduced pursuant to Bye-law 4.3(a)(ii); provided, further, that after the Restriction Termination Date, the provisions of this Bye-law 4.3(a) shall be inoperative and of no further force or effect:
(i)
The voting power to which the Controlled Shares of each Tentative 9.9% Shareholder would otherwise be entitled is hereby adjusted (and shall be automatically adjusted in the future) to the extent provided in Bye-law 4.3(a)(ii). The Board shall from time to time, including prior to any time at which a vote of Shareholders is taken, take all reasonable steps necessary to ascertain through communications with Shareholders or otherwise (including by reviewing publicly filed ownership reports of Shareholders filed pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act) whether there exists, or will exist at the time any vote of Shareholders is taken, a Tentative 9.9% Shareholder.
(ii)
In the event that any Tentative 9.9% Shareholder exists, then (A) the votes of the Controlled Shares of each such Tentative 9.9% Shareholder shall be reduced pro rata to the extent necessary such that the aggregate votes of such Controlled Shares constitute no more than 9.9% of the Total Voting Power; (B) the votes of all Restricted Common Shares shall be reduced to zero, except to the extent provided in Bye-law 4.3(b); and (C) the provisions of Bye-law 86 shall apply.
(iii)
The votes of all Class A Common Shares whose votes were not reduced pursuant to Bye-law 4.3(a)(ii) shall be increased pro rata based on their then current voting power, in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate reduction in votes of Class A Common Shares pursuant to Bye-law 4.3(a)(ii); provided, that such increase shall be limited as to any Class A Common Share to the extent necessary to avoid (A) causing any Person other than a Permitted 9.9% Shareholder to be a 9.9% Shareholder or (B) creating a RPII Control Group.
(b)
In connection with any vote of Shareholders to approve a merger or amalgamation with respect to the Company (a “Company Merger Vote”), each outstanding Restricted Common Share and each outstanding preferred share shall have the power to vote in connection with any such Company Merger Vote. Solely in connection with any such Company Merger Vote, any outstanding Restricted Common Shares (if they would otherwise have no votes pursuant to Bye-law 4.3(a)(ii)) and preferred shares shall collectively represent 0.1% of the Total Voting Power (such voting power allocated equally among such Restricted Common Shares and preferred shares) with the Total Voting Power attributable to each of the Class A Common Shares (other than such Restricted Common Shares) being reduced by such percentage on a pro-rated basis.
(c)
The Board may deviate from any of the principles described in this Bye-law 4.3 and determine that Class A Common Shares held by a Shareholder shall carry different voting rights (or no voting rights) as it determines appropriate (1) to avoid the existence of any 9.9% Shareholder other than any Permitted 9.9% Shareholder or (2) upon the request of a Shareholder, to avoid adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences for such Shareholder or any of its Affiliates or direct or indirect owners.
(d)    
(i)
The Board shall have the authority to request from any Person holding, directly or indirectly, Class A Common Shares, and such Person shall provide, as promptly as reasonably practicable, such information as the Board may require for the purpose of determining whether any Person’s voting rights are to be adjusted pursuant to these Bye-laws. If such Person fails to reasonably respond to such a request, or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to such a request, the Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, determine that such Person’s Class A Common Shares shall carry no voting rights or reduced voting rights, in which case such Class A Common Shares shall not carry any voting rights or shall carry only such reduced voting rights until otherwise determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion.




(ii)
Any Person shall give notice to the Company within ten days following the date that such Person acquires actual knowledge that it is a Tentative 9.9% Shareholder or that its Class A Common Shares are Controlled Shares of a Tentative 9.9% Shareholder.
(iii)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person shall be liable to any other Person or the Company for any losses or damages resulting from a Person’s failure to respond to, or submission of incomplete or inaccurate information in response to, a request under paragraph (i) above or from such Person’s failure to give notice under paragraph (ii) above. The Board may rely on the information provided by a Person under this Bye-law 4.3(d) in the satisfaction of its obligations under this Bye-law 4.3. The Company may, but shall have no obligation to, provide notice to any Person of any adjustment to its voting power that may result from the application of this Bye-law 4.3.
(iv)
Bye-law 4.3(a) and the definitions of “Permitted 9.9% Shareholder”, “Tentative 9.9% Shareholder” and “Restriction Termination Date” may not be rescinded, altered or amended (a) unless in accordance with the Act and (b) until the same has been approved by at least 70% of the Board (or, after March 31, 2021, 75% of the Board) and at least 50% of the Total Voting Power (which, for the avoidance of doubt will take into account the application of Bye-law 4.3).
(v)
For the avoidance of doubt, the Board may, in its discretion, grant its consent for certain Persons to be Permitted 9.9% Shareholders and need not grant its consent for other Persons. No consent obtained from the Board allowing a Person to be a Permitted 9.9% Shareholder may be revoked, rescinded or otherwise limited following the granting of such consent without the consent of such Person.
4.4    
(a)
The Class A Common Shares shall be entitled to such dividends, in proportion to the number of Class A Common Shares held by such holder, as the Board may from time to time declare.
(b)
In addition to the foregoing, upon a Liquidation, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the Company and payment or provision for payment for the aggregate liquidation preference for all outstanding preferred shares have each been made, distributions out of the remaining assets of the Company available for distribution to its Shareholders shall be made to the holders of the Class A Common Shares (on a pro-rata basis based upon the number of Class A Common Shares held by each such holder in proportion to the total number of Class A Common Shares then outstanding).
(c)
In the event of a Liquidation resulting from circumstances set forth in either clause (ii) or clause (iii) of the definition of Sale of the Company, the “remaining assets of the Company available for distribution” (as referred to in clause (b) above) shall be deemed to be the aggregate consideration to be paid to all holders of Class A Common Shares participating in such Liquidation. In connection with such a Liquidation, the holders of the Class A Common Shares shall allocate the aggregate consideration to be paid to all such Shareholders participating in such Liquidation among such Shareholders, such that each such Shareholder shall receive the same portion of the aggregate consideration from such Liquidation that such Shareholder would have received if such aggregate consideration had been distributed by the Company in a Liquidation caused by circumstances other than those set forth in clause (ii) or clause (iii) of the definition of Sale of the Company.
(d)
If any or all of the proceeds payable to the Shareholders in connection with a Liquidation are in a form other than cash or marketable securities, the fair market value of such consideration shall be determined in good faith by the Board.
4.5
All the rights attaching to a Treasury Share shall be suspended and shall not be exercised by the Company while it holds such Treasury Share and, except where required by the Act, all Treasury Shares shall be excluded from the calculation of any percentage or fraction of the share capital, or shares, of the Company.
4.6
All determinations to be made in connection with the application of the provisions set forth in this Bye-law 4 shall be made by the Company in its sole discretion, and any such determination shall be binding on all Shareholders and holders of securities of the Company.

owner), shall at any time knowingly permit itself to be a Related Insured Entity. No Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities who is a U.S. Person, shall knowingly permit itself (or, to its actual knowledge, any direct or indirect beneficial owner thereof) to own (directly, indirectly or constructively pursuant to Section 958 of the Code) outstanding capital stock of the Company or Equity Securities possessing 50% or more of (i) the total voting power of the Class A Common Shares or Equity Securities, or (ii) the total value of the Class A Common Shares or Equity Securities. No Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities (or, to its actual knowledge, any direct or indirect beneficial owner thereof) nor any “related person” (within the meaning of Section 953(c) of the Code) to such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities (or such owner) (in all cases, excluding any member of the Apollo Group) shall (i) acquire any interests (for this purpose, including any instrument or arrangement that is treated as an equity interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in Apollo Global Management, Inc. or (ii) make any investment, or enter into a transaction, that, to the actual knowledge of such Shareholder at the time such Shareholder, holder of Equity Securities, owner or related person becomes bound to make the investment or enter into the transaction, would cause such Shareholder, holder of Equity Securities, owner or related person, or any other U.S. Person, to own (directly, indirectly or constructively pursuant to Section 958 of the Code) outstanding capital stock of the Company or Equity Securities possessing 50% or more of (a) the total voting power of the Class A Common Shares or Equity Securities entitled to vote or (b) the total value of the Class A Common Shares or Equity Securities.
5.2
All determinations to be made in connection with the application of the provisions set forth in Bye-law 5.1 shall be made by the Board in its sole discretion, and any such determination shall be binding on all Shareholders, it being understood that a Shareholder will in no instance be liable for monetary damages with respect to a breach of this Bye-law 5. The Board may, at any time, and from time to time, request evidence and/or require representations that the restrictions set forth in this Bye-law 5 have not, or will not, be breached. Each Shareholder agrees to furnish such evidence to the Board promptly upon request therefor. The Board may waive any provision in this Bye-law 5 with respect to any Shareholder without granting similar waivers to any other Shareholder. The Board and any particular Shareholder may agree in writing to amend the application of the provisions of this Bye-law 5 with respect to such Shareholder, and the Board shall not be required to enter into similar agreements with other Shareholders.
5.3
In the event any Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities becomes aware that there is a material risk that it, any of its direct or indirect beneficial owners and/or any “related person” (within the meaning of Section 953(c) of the Code) to such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities (or such owner) has violated any provision contained in this Bye-law 5 (without regard to any knowledge qualifier therein), such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities will be obligated to notify the Board as promptly as possible. In the event any Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities violates Bye-law 5.1 (without regard to any knowledge qualifier therein), at the discretion of the Board, such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities shall, and shall cause any direct or indirect beneficial owner of such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities and any “related person” (within the meaning of Section 953(c) of the Code) to such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities to (x) sell some or all of its Class A Common Shares or Equity Securities at fair market value (as mutually agreed by the Company and such Shareholder in good faith) as directed by the Board and/or (y) allow the Company to repurchase some or all of its Class A Common Shares or Equity Securities at fair market value (as determined by the Company and such Shareholder in good faith); provided, that if the Company and such Shareholder cannot mutually agree on the fair market value of the Class A Common Shares or Equity Securities to be sold or repurchased in accordance with this Bye-law 5.3, then fair market value shall be determined by an investment banking firm of national recognition, which firm shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company and such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities. The determination of fair market value by such investment banking firm shall be final and binding upon the parties. If the Company and such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities are unable to agree upon an acceptable investment banking firm within ten (10) days after the date either party proposed that one be selected, the investment banking firm will be selected by an arbitrator located in the City of New York, New York selected by the American Arbitration Association (or if such organization ceases to exist, the arbitrator shall be chosen by a court of competent jurisdiction). The arbitrator shall select the investment banking firm (within ten (10) days of his appointment) from a list, jointly prepared by the Company and such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities, of not more than six investment banking firms of national standing in the United States, of which no more than three may be named by the Company and no more than three may be named by such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities. The arbitrator may consider, within the ten-day period allotted, arguments from the parties regarding which investment banking firm to choose, but the selection by the arbitrator shall be made in its sole discretion from the list of six. The selection by the arbitrator of such investment banking firm shall be final and binding upon the parties. The Company and such Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the investment banking firms and arbitrator (if any) used to determine the fair market value. If required by any such investment banking firm or arbitrator, the Company shall execute a retainer and engagement letter containing reasonable terms and conditions, including, without limitation, customary provisions concerning the rights of indemnification and contribution by the Company in favor of such investment banking firm or arbitrator and its officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and Affiliates. The parties shall provide to the investment banking firm, on a confidential basis, such information it reasonably requests to perform its duties.
5.4
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon a breach of this Bye-law 5 (without regard to any knowledge qualifier therein), the breaching Shareholder or holder of Equity Securities shall be required to take any reasonable action the Board deems appropriate.

The Board may make such calls as it thinks fit upon the Shareholders in respect of any moneys (whether in respect of nominal value or premium) unpaid on the shares allotted to or held by such Shareholders and, if a call is not paid on or before the day appointed for payment thereof, the Shareholders may at the discretion of the Board be liable to pay the Company interest on the amount of such call at such rate as the Board may determine, from the date when such call was payable up to the actual date of payment.

9.
Fractional Shares
The Company may issue its shares in fractional denominations and deal with such fractions to the same extent as its whole shares and shares in fractional denominations shall have in proportion to the respective fractions represented thereby all of the rights of whole shares including (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing) the right to vote, to receive dividends and distributions and to participate in a winding-up.

The following transfer restrictions are in addition to any transfer restrictions that may apply pursuant to the terms of any contract or other agreement between the Shareholders as among themselves or with any third parties or that the Company may enter into with any of its Shareholders.
12.2
An instrument of transfer shall be in writing in the form of the following, or as near thereto as circumstances admit, or in such other form as the Board may accept:
Transfer of a Share or Shares
Athene Holding Ltd. (the “Company”)

Transferor        Witness
_________________    _________________
Transferee        Witness
12.3
Such instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and transferee, provided, that in the case of a fully paid share, the Board may accept the instrument signed by or on behalf of the transferor alone. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of such share until the same has been registered as having been transferred to the transferee in the Register of Shareholders.
12.4
The Board may refuse to recognise any instrument of transfer unless it is accompanied by the certificate in respect of the shares to which it relates and by such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer.
12.5
The joint holders of any share may transfer such share to one or more of such joint holders, and the surviving holder or holders of any share previously held by them jointly with a deceased Shareholder may transfer any such share to the executors or administrators of such deceased Shareholder.
12.6
The Board may in its absolute discretion refuse to register the transfer of a share if, and only if, all applicable consents, authorisations and permissions of any governmental body or agency in Bermuda have not been obtained. If the Board refuses to register a transfer of any share, the Secretary shall, within three months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send to the transferor and transferee notice of the refusal.
13.

14.
Transmission of Registered Shares
14.1
Subject to the terms of any contracts or other agreements by and between the Shareholders or by and between the Company and any of its Shareholders, in the case of the death of a Shareholder, the survivor or survivors where the deceased Shareholder was a joint holder, and the legal personal representatives of the deceased Shareholder where the deceased Shareholder was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to the deceased Shareholder’s interest in the shares. Nothing herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by such deceased Shareholder with other persons.

14.4
Where two or more persons are registered as joint holders of a share or shares, then in the event of the death of any joint holder or holders the remaining joint holder or holders shall be absolutely entitled to such share or shares and the Company shall recognise no claim in respect of the estate of any joint holder except in the case of the last survivor of such joint holders.

16.
Variation of Rights Attaching to Shares
Subject to any contract or agreement by and between the Shareholders or by and between the Company and any of its Shareholders, which contains provisions affecting the rights attaching to shares of the Company, if, at any time, the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, as the case may be) may, whether or not the Company is being wound-up, be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of a majority of the issued shares of that class (as the case may be) or with the sanction of a resolution passed by a majority of the votes cast at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class at which meeting the necessary quorum shall be two persons at least holding or representing by proxy one-third of the issued shares of the class, as the case may be. The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith.

If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.
17.5
The Company may pay dividends in proportion to the amount paid up on each share where a larger amount is paid up on some shares than on others.

If two or more persons are registered as joint holders of any shares any one can give an effectual receipt for any dividend paid in respect of such shares.
19.3
The Board may deduct from the dividends or distributions payable to any Shareholder all moneys due from such Shareholder to the Company on account of calls or otherwise.
20.
Capitalisation
20.1

20.2
The Board may capitalise any amount for the time being standing to the credit of a reserve account or amounts otherwise available for dividend or distribution by applying such amounts in paying up in full, partly or nil paid shares of those Shareholders who would have been entitled to such amounts if they were distributed by way of dividend or distribution.

37.2
Notice of a written resolution shall be given, and a copy of the resolution shall be circulated to all Shareholders who would be entitled to attend a meeting and vote thereon.

37.3
Any Shareholder seeking to have the Shareholders authorize or take action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary of the Company signed by Shareholders holding not less than (25%) of the Total Voting Power (which, for the avoidance of doubt will take into account the application of Bye-law 4.3), who shall not revoke such request, and complying with the procedures set forth in this Bye-law 37.3 (such Shareholder(s), together with any beneficial owner(s) on whose behalf such requisition is made and the Affiliates of each of the foregoing, the “Record Date Requesting Shareholder(s)”), request the Board to fix a record date for such consent (each such notice, a “Record Date Request”) in proper form.

of business proposed to be considered pursuant to such action by written resolution, as if such business were to be considered at an annual general meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Bye-laws, upon receipt of a Record Date Request, the Board may require the Shareholder(s) submitting such request to furnish such other information as may be requested by the Board to determine the validity of the Record Date Request and to determine whether such request relates to an action that may be effected by written resolution of Shareholders in lieu of a meeting under this Bye-law 37 and Applicable Law.
37.4
The Board shall, within twenty (20) days after the date on which a Record Date Request is received, or five (5) days after the delivery of any information requested by the Company to determine the validity of any such request or whether the action to which such Record Date Request relates is an action that may be taken by written resolution of Shareholders in lieu of a meeting, determine the validity of the Record Date Request and whether the Request relates to an action that may be authorized or taken by consent pursuant to Bye-law 37. If the Board determines that such request is valid, the Board shall adopt a resolution fixing the record date for such purpose. Such record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board.

Every written resolution shall bear the date of the signature of each Shareholder who signs the written resolution and no written resolution shall be effective to take the action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days after the earliest date such written resolution is received, a valid written resolution or valid written resolutions signed by a sufficient number of Shareholders to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner prescribed by this Bye-law and Applicable Law and not revoked. Any Shareholder giving a written resolution, or the Shareholder’s proxy holder, may revoke the consent in any manner permitted by Applicable Law. Delivery must be made by hand or by mail, return receipt requested. In addition, the Company shall be entitled to engage independent inspectors of elections to perform a ministerial review of the validity of the written resolutions. No action by written resolution shall be effective until such inspectors have completed their review and certified to the Company that the consents delivered to the Company in accordance with this Bye-law 37 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, in accordance with this Bye-law 37.
37.6
No action may be authorized or taken by the Shareholders by written resolution except in accordance with this Bye-law 37.

If the Board shall determine that any Request was not properly made in accordance with, or relates to an action that may not be effected by consent pursuant to, Bye-law 37, or any Shareholders seeking to authorize or take such action do not otherwise comply with this Bye-law 37, then the Board shall not be required to fix a record date and any such purported action by consent shall be null and void to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. Nothing contained in this Bye-law 37 shall be construed to imply that the Board or any Shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or related revocations, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Bye-law 37, (x) none of the foregoing provisions of this Bye-law 37 shall apply to any solicitation of action by written resolution by or at the direction of the Board and (y) the Board shall be entitled to solicit action by consent in accordance with Applicable Law.
37.7
A written resolution is passed when it is signed by, or in the case of a Shareholder that is a corporation, on behalf of, the Shareholders who at the date that the notice is given represent more than 55% of the Total Voting Power.
37.8
A resolution in writing may be signed in any number of counterparts.
37.9
A resolution in writing made in accordance with this Bye-law is as valid as if it had been passed by the Company in general meeting or by a meeting of the relevant class of Shareholders, as the case may be, and any reference in any Bye-law to a meeting at which a resolution is passed or to Shareholders voting in favour of a resolution shall be construed accordingly.

on behalf of, the last Shareholder whose signature results in the necessary Total Voting Power being achieved and any reference in any Bye-law to the date of passing of a resolution is, in relation to a resolution made in accordance with this Bye-law, a reference to such date.

Except where special representation is required by the default provisions of a class or classes of preferred shares or as contemplated by the Shareholders Agreement, clause (b) of this Bye-law 40.1 shall be the exclusive means for a Shareholder to make nominations of persons for election to the Board at an annual general meeting.
40.2
Any Shareholder entitled to vote for the election of Directors may nominate a person or persons for election as Directors only if written notice of such Shareholder’s intent to make such nomination is given in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Bye-law 40, either by personal delivery or express or registered mail (postage prepaid), to the Secretary at the Registered Office not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the one-year anniversary of the date of the annual general meeting for the immediately preceding year. However, in the event that the date of the annual general meeting is more than 30 days before or after such anniversary date, in order to be timely, a Shareholder’s notice must be received by the Secretary at the Registered Office not later than the later of (x) the close of business 90 days prior to the date of such annual general meeting and (y) if the first public announcement of the date of such advanced or delayed annual general meeting is less than 100 days prior to such date, 10 days following the date of the first public announcement of the annual general meeting date. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual general meeting, or such adjournment or postponement, commence a new time period or otherwise extend any time period for the giving of a Shareholder’s notice as described herein. Shareholders may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to the Board only as provided in this Bye-law and only for such class(es) or slate(s) as are specified in the Company’s notice of meeting as being up for election at such annual general meeting.
40.3
Each such notice of a Shareholder’s intent to make a nomination of a Director shall set forth:
(a)
as to the Shareholder giving notice and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, (1) the name and address of such Shareholder (as it appears in the Register of Shareholders) and any such beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, (2) the class and number of Equity Securities which are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and of record by such Shareholder and any such beneficial owner, respectively, or their respective Affiliates (naming such Affiliates), as of the date of such notice, (3) a description of any Covered Arrangement to which such Shareholder or beneficial owner, or their respective Affiliates, directly or indirectly, is a party as of the date of such notice, (4) any other information relating to such Shareholder and any such beneficial owner that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement in connection with a solicitation of proxies for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (5) a representation that the Shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in such Shareholder’s notice;




(b)
a description of all arrangements or understandings between the Shareholder or any beneficial owner, or their respective Affiliates, and each nominee or any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the Shareholder;
(c)
a representation whether the Shareholder or the beneficial owner is or intends to be part of a Group which intends (i) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Class A Common Shares (or other Equity Securities) required to elect the Director or Directors nominated and/or (ii) otherwise to solicit proxies from Shareholders in support of such nomination or nominations;
(d)
as to each person whom the Shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a Director, (1) all information relating to such person as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed in connection with a solicitation of proxies for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (2) a description of any Covered Arrangement to which such nominee or any of his or her Affiliates is a party as of the date of such notice, (3) the written consent of each nominee to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if so elected and (4) whether, if elected, the nominee intends to tender any advance resignation notice(s) requested by the Board in connection with subsequent elections, such advance resignation to be contingent upon the nominee’s failure to receive a majority vote and acceptance of such resignation by the Board; and

an undertaking by the Shareholder of record and each beneficial owner, if any, to (i) notify the Company in writing of the information set forth in clauses (a)(2), (a)(3), (b) and (d) above as of the record date for the meeting promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days) following the later of the record date or the date notice of the record date is first disclosed by public announcement and (ii) update such information thereafter within two (2) Business Days of any change in such information and, in any event, as of close of business on the day preceding the meeting date.
40.4
Except where as otherwise required by the default provisions of a class or classes of preferred shares or as contemplated by the Shareholders Agreement, no person shall be eligible for election as a Director unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bye-laws. Except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law or these Bye-laws, the presiding officer of any meeting of Shareholders to elect Directors or the Board may, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure or if the Shareholder solicits proxies in support of such Shareholder’s nominee(s) without such Shareholder having made the representation required by clause (c) of Bye-law 40.3; and if the presiding officer or the Board should so determine, it shall be so declared to the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding anything in these Bye-laws to the contrary, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which shares of the Company may be then listed or quoted, if a Shareholder intending to make a nomination at a general meeting in accordance with this Bye-law 40 does not (i) timely provide the notifications contemplated by clause (e) of Bye-law 40.3, or (ii) timely appear in person or by proxy at the annual general meeting to present the nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such nomination may have been received by the Company or any other person or entity.
40.5
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Bye-law 40, any Shareholder intending to make a nomination at an annual general meeting in accordance with this Bye-law 40, and each related beneficial owner, if any, shall also comply with all requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the same extent as if the shares of the Company were registered under the Exchange Act with respect to the matters set forth in these Bye-laws; provided, however, that any references in these Bye-laws to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations made or intended to be made in accordance with clause (b) of Bye-law 40.1.
40.6
Nothing in this Bye-law 40 shall be deemed to affect (i) any rights of the holders of any series of preferred shares, or any other series or class of shares authorised to be issued by the Company, to elect directors pursuant to the terms thereof or (ii) any rights of the members of the Apollo Group that are party to the Shareholders Agreement to nominate Directors to the Board pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement.
40.7
To be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as a Director pursuant to Bye-law 40.1(b), a person must deliver (not later than the deadline prescribed for delivery of notice) to the Secretary at the Registered Office a written questionnaire prepared by the Company with respect to the background and qualification of such person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made (which questionnaire shall be provided by the Secretary upon written request) and a written representation and agreement (in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request) that such person: (i) is not and will not become a party to (A) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a Director, will act or vote on any issue or question (a “Voting Commitment”) that has not been disclosed to the Company or (B) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person’s ability to comply, if elected as a Director, with such person’s duties under Applicable Law; (ii) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Company with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or




indemnification in connection with service or action as a Director that has not been disclosed therein; (iii) in such person’s individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if elected as a Director, and will comply with, Applicable Law and corporate governance, conflict of interest, corporate opportunity, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Company that are applicable to Directors generally and (iv) if elected as a Director, will act in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders and not in the interest of any individual constituency. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall review all such information submitted by the Shareholder with respect to the proposed nominee and determine whether such nominee is eligible to act as a Director. The Company and the Nominating and Governance Committee may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an Independent Director or that could be material to a reasonable Shareholder’s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
40.8
At each annual general meeting of the Shareholders for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, each Director or slate of Directors shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the Director or slate, excluding abstentions. For purposes of this Bye-law 40.8, a majority of the votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted “for” a Director or slate of Directors must exceed the number of votes “against” that Director or slate of Directors.
40.9
At the request of the Board, any person nominated for election as a director of the Company shall furnish to the Secretary the information that is required to be set forth in a Shareholders’ notice of nomination pursuant to Bye-law 40.
40.10
Other than with respect to nominations made in accordance with the default provisions of a class or classes of preferred shares or under the Shareholders Agreement, any Shareholder proposing to nominate a person or persons for election shall be responsible for, and bear the costs associated with, soliciting votes from any other voting Shareholder and distributing materials to such Shareholders prior to the annual general meeting in accordance with these Bye-laws and applicable SEC rules. A Shareholder shall include any person or persons such Shareholder intends to nominate for election in its own proxy statement and proxy card.
40.11
Unless prohibited by Applicable Law, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days of receipt of written request from any Shareholder proposing to nominate a person or persons for election) provide to such proposing Shareholder the names and addresses of all persons and entities who are record holders of the Company’s shares (the “Other Holders”), provided, that if any Other Holder has requested that its identity or address be kept confidential, then the Company shall (at the expense of such Shareholder) promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days of receipt of a written request) forward to such Other Holder any materials provided by such Shareholder in relation to the person or persons such Shareholder intends to nominate for election and a notice requesting that such Other Holder contact such Shareholder.
41.

42.
Number of Directors
The number of Directors which shall constitute the entire Board shall be such as from time to time shall be determined by Resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, but the number shall not be less than two or more than seventeen; provided, that the tenure of a Director shall not be affected by a decrease in the number of Directors so made by the Board.
43.
Term of Office of Directors
The Directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the number of Directors constituting the Board, Class I to hold office initially for a term expiring at the annual general meeting to be held in 2016, Class II to hold office initially for a term expiring at the annual general meeting to be held in 2017, and Class III to hold office initially for a term expiring at the annual general meeting to be held in 2018. At each succeeding annual general meeting beginning in 2016, successors to the class of Directors whose term expires at that annual general meeting shall be elected for a three (3) year term with each Director to hold office in such class until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such Director’s earlier death, resignation or removal. If the number of Directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of Directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional Director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class or from the removal from office, death, disability, resignation or disqualification of a Director or other cause shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no event will a decrease in the authorised number of Directors shorten the term of any incumbent Director.
44.
Removal of Directors
44.1
Subject to any provision to the contrary in these Bye-laws, a Director may only be removed for cause and not otherwise. The removal of a Director for cause shall be effected either (i) by the Board by affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors at any duly called meeting of the Board or (ii) by the Shareholders holding a majority of the Total Voting Power at any general meeting called and held in accordance with these Bye-laws. For purposes of this Bye-law 44.1, “cause” shall mean




a conviction for a criminal offence involving dishonesty or engaging in conduct which brings the Director or the Company into disrepute or which results in a material financial detriment to the Company.
44.2
If a Director is removed from the Board under this Bye-law 44, the Board may fill the vacancy. Persons appointed by the Board to fill a vacancy shall be approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Board and shall be subject to election at the immediately succeeding annual general meeting.
45.

45.1
The office of Director shall be vacated immediately if the Director:
(a)
is prohibited from being a Director by law;

is or becomes of unsound mind or a patient for any purpose of any statute or Applicable Law relating to mental health and the Board resolves that his office is vacated, or dies;
(d)
by virtue of holding the office of Director causes the Company to be taxed in an adverse manner; or
(e)
resigns his office by notice to the Secretary.
45.2
If there is a vacancy on the Board occurring as a result of the death, disability, disqualification or resignation of any Director, or on account of an increase in the number of members of the Board or a failure to elect a Director at an annual general meeting, subject to the rights of the members of the Apollo Group that are parties to the Shareholders Agreement to nominate Directors to the Board, the Board may appoint any person as a Director on an interim basis until the next annual general meeting, provided, that such person has been approved to serve as a Director by the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Board vacancy shall be submitted to a vote at the next succeeding annual general meeting irrespective of class.
46.
Remuneration of Directors
The remuneration (if any) of the Directors shall be determined by the Board or an appropriate committee thereof delegated by the Board. The Directors shall also be paid all reasonable travel, hotel and related expenses incurred by them in attending and returning from the meetings of the Board, any committee appointed by the Board, general meetings, or in connection with the business of the Company or their duties as Directors generally. The Company shall also bear reasonable travel, hotel and related expenses incurred by any advisors to the Board related to such matters.
47.
Defect in Appointment
All acts done in good faith by the Board, any Director, a member of a committee appointed by the Board, any person to whom the Board may have delegated any of its powers, or any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that he was, or any of them were, disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director or act in the relevant capacity.

Conflicts of Interest
55.1
Any Director, or any Director’s firm, partner or any company with whom any Director is associated, may act in any capacity for, be employed by or render services to the Company and such Director or such Director’s firm, partner or company shall be entitled to remuneration as if such Director were not a Director. Nothing herein contained shall authorise a Director or Director’s firm, partner or company to act as Auditor to the Company.




55.2
A Director who is directly or indirectly interested in a contract or proposed contract or arrangement with the Company shall declare the nature of such interest as required by the Act.
55.3
Following a declaration being made pursuant to this Bye-law, a Director may vote in respect of any contract or proposed contract or arrangement in which such Director is interested and may be counted in the quorum for such meeting and, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the interested Director shall not be liable to account to the Company for any profit realized thereby. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, in the event that one or more interested Directors are disqualified or elect to be recused from voting on a matter, or one or more Directors are later found to have an interest or conflict that should have been declared, the matter shall be approved or stand approved if it is or was approved by a majority of the votes cast by the Directors that do not have any interest or conflict in the matter, even if less than a quorum.
55.4
Subject to the Act and any further disclosure required thereby, a general notice to the Directors by a Director or officer declaring that he is a director or officer or has an interest in any business entity and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction or arrangement made with that business entity shall be sufficient declaration of interest in relation to any transaction or arrangement so made.
55.5
This Bye-law 55 shall be subject to any U.S. securities laws and the rules of any exchange or quotation system on which the Company’s shares are then listed.
56.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise described in Bye-law 56.10, the Company shall be required to indemnify a Person described in such sentence in connection with any Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by such Person was authorised by the Board. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Shareholder agrees to waive any claim or right of action such Shareholder might have, whether individually or by or in right of the Company, against any Covered Person on account of any action taken by such Covered Person, or the failure of such Covered Person to take any action in the performance of such Covered Person’s duties with or for the Company or any subsidiary thereof; provided, that such waiver shall not extend to any matter in respect of any fraud or dishonesty in relation to the Company or its Subsidiaries which may attach to such Covered Person.
56.2
To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Expenses incurred by a Covered Person in appearing at, participating in or defending any indemnifiable Proceeding pursuant to this Bye-law 56 shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Company prior to a final and non-appealable disposition of the Proceeding in which it is determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay such amount if it ultimately shall be determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Bye-law 56. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Bye-law 56.10, the Company shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence in connection with any Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by such Person was authorised by the Board.




56.3
The indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided by this Bye-law 56 shall be in addition to any other rights to which a Covered Person may be entitled under these Bye-laws or any agreement between the Company and such Covered Person, pursuant to a vote of a majority of disinterested Directors with respect to such matter, as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise, both as to actions in the Covered Person’s capacity as a Covered Person and as to actions in any other capacity, and shall continue as to a Covered Person who has ceased to serve in such capacity.
56.4
The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a Covered Person, and such other Persons as the Board shall determine, against any Liability that may be asserted against, or Expense that may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the Company’s activities or any such Person’s activities on behalf of the Company, regardless of whether the Company would have the power to indemnify such Person against such Liability or Expense under the provisions of these Bye-laws or Applicable Law.
56.5
For purposes of this Bye-law 56 (i) the Company shall be deemed to have requested a Covered Person to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Company also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such Covered Person to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan and (ii) excise taxes assessed on a Covered Person with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to Applicable Law shall constitute “fines” within the meaning of “Liabilities”.
56.6
A Covered Person shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Bye-law 56 because the Covered Person had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by these Bye-laws.
56.7
Except with respect to any Shareholder Affiliate, which shall be a third party beneficiary of the rights set forth in Bye-law 56.12, the provisions of this Bye-law 56 are for the benefit of the Covered Persons and their heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.
56.8
Each Covered Person shall, in the performance of his, her or its duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Company and on such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Company by any of the Officers, Directors or employees of the Company, or any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company’s Subsidiaries, or committees of the Board, or by any other Person (including legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and advisers selected by or on behalf of it) as to matters such Covered Person reasonably believes are within such other Person’s professional or expert competence.
56.9
No amendment, modification or repeal of this Bye-law 56 or any provision hereof or, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any modification of Applicable Law, shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future Covered Person to be indemnified or to have such Covered Person’s Expenses advanced by the Company, nor the obligations of the Company to indemnify or advance Expenses to any such Covered Person under and in accordance with the provisions of this Bye-law 56 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or-in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.
56.10
If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of the Proceeding for which indemnification is being sought) or advancement of Expenses under this Bye-law 56 is not paid in full within thirty (30) days after a written claim therefor by any Covered Person has been received by the Company, such Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the Expenses of prosecuting such claim, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
56.11
This Bye-law 56 shall not limit the right of the Company, to the extent and in the manner permitted by Applicable Law, to indemnify and to advance Expenses to, and purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of Persons other than Covered Persons.
56.12
The Company hereby acknowledges that the indemnitees under this Bye-law 56 (the “Indemnified Persons”) may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of Expenses and/or insurance provided by shareholders, members of the Apollo Group, or other Affiliates of the Company or Affiliates of members of the Apollo Group (“Shareholder Affiliates”) separate from the indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided by the Company under these Bye-laws. The Company hereby agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the Indemnified Persons under these Bye-laws are primary and any obligation of any Shareholder Affiliate to advance Expenses or to provide indemnification for the same Expenses or Liabilities incurred by the Indemnified Persons are secondary), (ii) that the Company shall be required to advance the full amount of Expenses incurred by the Indemnified Persons and shall be liable for the full amount of all Expenses and Liabilities paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by Bye-law 56, without regard to any rights the Indemnified Persons may have against any Shareholder Affiliate, and (iii) that the Company irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Shareholder Affiliates from any and all claims against the Shareholder Affiliates for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Company further agrees that no advancement or payment by any Shareholder Affiliate on behalf of an Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which such Indemnified Person has sought indemnification from the Company pursuant to Bye-law 56 shall affect the




foregoing and the Shareholder Affiliates shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnified Person against the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, no Person providing directors’ or officers’ or similar insurance obtained or maintained by or on behalf of the Company, and of its Affiliates or any of the foregoing’s respective Subsidiaries, including any Person providing such insurance obtained or maintained pursuant to Bye-law 56.4, shall be, or be deemed to be, a Shareholder Affiliate.
56.13
No Covered Person shall be personally liable either to the Company or to any of its Shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Covered Person, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under Applicable Law as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Bye-law inconsistent with the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a Covered Person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.
56.14
Any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this Bye-law 56.
56.15
This Bye-law 56 may not be rescinded, altered or amended (a) unless in accordance with the Act and (b) until the same has been approved by the Board and at least 50% of the Total Voting Power (which, for the avoidance of doubt will take into account the application of Bye-law 4.3).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries do not renounce any right, interest or expectancy in any business opportunity offered to a Specified Party who is a Director or Officer if such business opportunity is expressly offered for the Company or its Subsidiaries to such person solely in his or her capacity as a Director or Officer (a “Company Opportunity”); provided, however, that all of the protections of this Bye-law 57 shall otherwise apply to the Specified Parties with respect to such Company Opportunity, including the ability of the Specified Parties to pursue or acquire such Company Opportunity, directly or indirectly, or to direct such Company Opportunity to another person, if and to the extent that the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, determines not to pursue such Company Opportunity or if it is subsequently determined by the Board or any committee thereof (or board of directors or other governing body of such Subsidiary or any committee thereof), or by any court of competent jurisdiction, that the business opportunity was not in the line of business of the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, was not of material or practical advantage to the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, or was one that the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, was not financially capable of undertaking. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, other than its Insurance Subsidiaries, hereby waives and renounces any right, interest or expectancy of the Company or its Subsidiaries to participate in or be offered an opportunity to participate in any business or business opportunity of any member of the Apollo Group or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), except to the extent such right, interest or expectancy is expressly granted to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under a binding agreement between or among the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any member of the Apollo Group or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand.




57.2

57.5
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, under no circumstances shall the provisions of this Bye-law 57 (other than this Bye-law 57.5) apply to (or result in or be deemed to result in a limitation or elimination of) any duty (contractual, fiduciary or otherwise, whether at law or in equity) owed by any Specified Party who is also an Officer, employee or agent of the Company, or any director, officer, employee or agent of any of its Subsidiaries (other than any such Specified Party who is also an officer, director, employee, managing director, general or limited partner, manager, member, shareholder, agent or other Affiliate of any member of the Apollo Group or of any Affiliate of any member of the Apollo Group (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)), and any business opportunity waived or renounced by any Person pursuant to such other provisions of this Bye-law 57 shall be expressly reserved and maintained (and shall not be waived or renounced) by such Person as to any such Specified Party.
57.6
This Bye-law 57 may not be rescinded, altered or amended (a) unless in accordance with the Act and (b) until the same has been approved by the Board and at least 50% of the Total Voting Power (which, for the avoidance of doubt will take into account the application of Bye-law 4.3).

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Bye-laws to the contrary (but subject to Bye-law 86.2 and Bye-law 86.3), if the Company, in its capacity as a shareholder of any Subsidiary of the Company, has the right to vote at a general meeting or special meeting of such Subsidiary (whether in person or by its attorney-in-fact or proxy) (or by written resolution in lieu of a general meeting or special meeting), and the subject matter of the vote is (a) the appointment, removal or remuneration of directors of a non-U.S. Subsidiary of the Company or (b) any other subject matter with respect to a non-U.S. Subsidiary that legally requires the approval of the shareholders of such non-U.S. Subsidiary, the Board shall refer the subject matter of the vote to the Shareholders and seek authority from the Shareholders entitled to vote for the Board for the Company’s corporate representative or proxy to vote with respect to the resolution proposed by such Subsidiary.  The Board shall cause the Company’s corporate representative or proxy to vote the Company’s shares in such Subsidiary pro rata to the votes received at the general meeting of the Company, with votes for or against the directing resolution being taken, respectively, as an instruction for the Company’s corporate representative or proxy to vote the appropriate proportion of its share for and the appropriate proportion of its shares against the resolution proposed by such Subsidiary. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Bye-law 86 and Bye-law 87, the term “non-U.S. Subsidiary” shall mean a Subsidiary that is treated as a non-U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If the Board in its discretion, determines that the application of Bye-law 86.1(b) with respect to a particular vote is not necessary to achieve the purposes of this Bye-law 86, it may waive the application of Bye-law 86.1(b) with respect to such vote.
86.3
Notwithstanding any provision in these Bye-laws to the contrary, this Bye-law 86 shall only apply if and when applicable pursuant to Bye-law 4.3(a)(ii).

The Board shall require that the Bye-laws or Articles of Association or similar organizational documents of each non-U.S. Subsidiary of the Company shall contain provisions substantially similar to Bye-law 86.1, Bye-law 86.3 and Bye-law 87. The Company shall enter into agreements, as and when determined by the Board, with each such non-U.S. Subsidiary, only if and to the extent reasonably necessary and permitted under Applicable Law, to effectuate or implement this Bye-law.
87.2
From and after the Restriction Termination Date, the provisions of this Bye-law 87 shall be inoperative and of no further force or effect.

or any of its Subsidiaries and a member of the Apollo Group (a “New IMA”) (a) on any date other than June 4, 2023 or any two (2)-year anniversary of such date (each, an “IMA Termination Election Date”) and (b) unless it has provided written notice to ISG or the member of the Apollo Group that is a party to such New IMA, as applicable, of such termination at least thirty (30) days, but not more than ninety (90) days, prior to the applicable IMA Termination Election Date (an “IMA Termination Notice”); provided, that (i) the IMA or any New IMA may only be terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company with the approval of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors in accordance with the immediately following sentence (an IMA Termination Notice delivered with such approval and in accordance with Bye-law 88.1(a) and (b), a “Valid IMA Termination Notice”) and (ii) notwithstanding any such election to terminate or delivery of a Valid IMA Termination Notice, no such termination shall be effective on any date earlier than the second annual anniversary of the applicable IMA Termination Election Date (the “IMA Termination Effective Date”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Bye-law 88.1, the Board shall not approve any election to terminate the IMA or any New IMA on any IMA Termination Election Date pursuant to this Bye-law 88.1 unless at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors agree that an event described in clause (iii) or (iv) of the definition of AHL Cause occurred with respect to the IMA or such New IMA, as applicable. If the Company and/or applicable Subsidiary of the Company does not provide a Valid IMA Termination Notice with respect to an IMA Termination Election Date, then the Company or such Subsidiary may only elect to terminate such IMA or New IMA under this Bye-law 88.1 on the next IMA Termination Election Date, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall terminate any such IMA or New IMA in accordance with this Bye-law 88.1 without providing a Valid IMA Termination Notice. Furthermore, beginning on June 4, 2019, the IMA and any New IMA shall be subject to an initial term of four (4) years from such date; provided that, on each IMA Termination Election Date after June 4, 2019, beginning with the IMA Termination Election Date on June 4, 2023, to the extent no Valid IMA Termination Notice has been delivered in accordance with this Bye-law 88.1 with respect to the IMA or any New IMA, the term of the IMA and each such New IMA shall be extended automatically without any further action or obligation by any persons (including, without limitation, the parties thereto or hereto) for a period of two (2) additional years; provided, further that, if a Valid IMA Termination Notice has been previously delivered in accordance with this Bye-law 88.1 and has not been rescinded prior to the applicable IMA Termination Effective Date, this sentence shall no longer be of any force or effect with respect to the IMA or such New IMA that is the subject of such delivered Valid IMA Termination Notice and the term of the IMA or such New IMA subject to such Valid IMA Termination Notice shall continue through the end of the IMA Remediation Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the term of any IMA or New IMA shall be extended for the IMA Remediation Period.
88.2
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Bye-law 88.1, the Company and/or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company may terminate the IMA or any New IMA upon the occurrence of an event described in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of AHL Cause with respect to the IMA or such New IMA, as applicable; provided, that any termination of the IMA or any New IMA by the Company or Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, for such AHL Cause shall require the approval of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors and the delivery of written notice to ISG or such member of the Apollo Group that is a party to such New IMA, as applicable, of such termination for such AHL Cause at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination; provided, further, that in each case ISG or the member of the Apollo Group that is a party to the applicable IMA or New IMA, as applicable, shall have the right to dispute such determination of the Independent Directors within thirty (30) days after receiving notice from the Company of such determination, in which case the parties to such IMA or New IMA, as applicable, shall submit the question as to whether the conditions of AHL Cause have been met to binding arbitration in accordance with Section 12 of the seventh amended and restated fee agreement dated June 10, 2019 between the Company and ISG, as amended from time to time (the “Fee Agreement”), and such IMA or New IMA, as applicable, shall continue to remain in effect during the period of the arbitration.
88.3
For the avoidance of doubt, subject in all respects to the other provisions of this Bye-law 88 and the definition of AHL Cause, any termination of the IMA or any New IMA by the Company and/or any Subsidiary of the Company shall require the approval of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of this Bye-law 88 and the definition of AHL Cause, (x) no officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute an Independent Director and (y) no officer or employee of (1) any member of the Apollo Group described in clauses (i) through (iv) of the definition of Apollo Group or (2) Apollo Global Management, Inc. or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any Subsidiary that constitutes any portfolio company (or investment) of (A) an investment fund or other investment vehicle whose general partner, managing member or similar governing person is owned, directly or indirectly, by Apollo Global Management, Inc. or by one or more of its Subsidiaries or (B) a managed account agreement (or similar arrangement) whereby Apollo Global Management, Inc. or one or more of its Subsidiaries serves as general partner, managing member or in a similar governing position) shall constitute an Independent Director.
88.4
This Bye-law 88 may not be rescinded, altered or amended (a) unless in accordance with the Act and (b) until the same has been approved by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors and at least 50% of the Total Voting Power (which, for the avoidance of doubt will take into account the application of Bye-law 4.3).
AHL Cause means, (i) with respect to the IMA, a material violation of Applicable Law relating to ISG’s advisory business, and with respect to a New IMA, a material violation of Applicable Law relating to the advisory business of the member of the Apollo Group that is a party to such New IMA, in each case that is materially detrimental to the Company, (ii) the gross negligence, willful misconduct or reckless disregard of any of the obligations of ISG under the IMA or the member of the Apollo Group that is a party to the applicable New IMA under such New IMA, as applicable, that is materially detrimental




to the Company, (iii) the unsatisfactory long term performance of ISG under the IMA, or the member of the Apollo Group that is a party to the applicable New IMA under such a New IMA, as applicable, that is materially detrimental to the Company, as determined in the sole discretion of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors, acting in good faith or (iv) a determination in the sole discretion of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors, acting in good faith, that the fees charged by ISG under the IMA, or by the member of the Apollo Group that is a party to the applicable New IMA under such New IMA, as applicable, in each case, taking into account, without duplication, the Fee Agreement, are unfair and excessive compared to a Comparable Asset Manager, provided, however, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), the Independent Directors shall deliver written notice of such finding to ISG or such other member of the Apollo Group, as applicable, and ISG or such other member of the Apollo Group, as applicable, shall have until the applicable IMA Termination Effective Date to address the Independent Directors’ concerns and; provided further, that in the case of clause (iv), ISG or such other member of the Apollo Group, as applicable, shall have a right to lower its fees to match a Comparable Asset Manager. If ISG or such member of the Apollo Group has addressed the Independent Directors’ concerns (with the assessment of whether the Independent Directors’ concerns have been addressed being rendered thereby in good faith with the approval of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors) or, if applicable, lowered its fees to match a Comparable Asset Manager, then the applicable IMA Termination Notice shall be deemed rescinded and of no further force or effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the occurrence of an event constituting AHL Cause under the IMA shall not constitute an event of AHL Cause under any New IMA and vice versa, unless such event of AHL Cause shall be separately established thereunder.

The Assumption Consent Agreement will be amended and restated in its entirely to replace ALRe with AARe. Finally, Rocky Range and ALRe entered into a Retrocession Agreement, effective as of June 1, 2018 (the “Retrocession Agreement”), whereby, ALRe agreed that it would reinsure the GMIB Business from Rocky Range in the event that the Assumption Consent Agreement is ever terminated.
