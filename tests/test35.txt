Page 13 of 60

Execution Version

In addition to the above, the Parties have agreed to consider the following elements as debt- and/or cash-like at Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, these elements are the result of a negotiation and are not accounted for in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year 2017.
Each of the above items or elements shall be calculated in accordance with Belgian GAAP, applied consistently in accordance with prior years.
h)
Elements of negotiation between Parties:
ix.
Employee related liabilities - The Purchaser is of the opinion, on the basis of its own analysis, that some employee related liabilities that are not accounted for in the Group Companies balance sheet, should have been accounted for in accordance with US GAAP, such as: seniority days in Belgium, additional German pension plan, German jubilee plan, Belgian jubilee plan and Belgian pension plan. The Purchaser and the Sellers have negotiated a lump-sum amount of EUR 6,500,000 (six million five hundred thousand euros) to cover these. If, in accordance with Belgian GAAP, the Belgian pension plan liability would exceed EUR 400,000 (four hundred thousand euros), the excess of liability would be added to this lump sum amount for purposes of calculating the Net Debt. For the avoidance of doubt, this adjustment results in a negative adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price (i.e., debt-like component).
x.
Value of the Existing Operational Hedges - The Parties have agreed to consider 50% of the Value of the Existing Operational Hedges as a price adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, and given the uncertainty about the evolution of the foreign exchange rate, this element will impact on the Initial Purchase Price as follows:
•
Any upward adjustment in case the Value of the Existing Operational Hedges would be positive (i.e., cash-like);
•
Any downward adjustment in case the Value of the Existing Operational Hedges would be negative (i.e., debt-like).
xi.
Break up fee - The parties have agreed that at or immediately following Closing, the Purchaser is entitled to repay outstanding indebtedness of the Group towards financial institutions and any outstanding financial instruments listed in Schedule 5, and that make-whole amounts incurred in connection with such repayment will be treated as a debt-like component up to a maximum amount of EUR 3,304,400 (three million three hundred four thousand four hundred euros), to be decreased by the related tax effect. For the avoidance of doubt, this adjustment results in a negative adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price.



Page 14 of 60

Execution Version

xii.
Belfius factoring - The Parties have agreed that, to the extent the anticipated payment for such accounts receivable has not resulted in a decrease of Net Working Capital, Net Debt shall be increased by any accounts receivable for which the Group Companies have received anticipated payment from Belfius Commercial Finance pursuant to the Full Service Factoring Agreement, dated December 15, 2015 (and as the same may be amended from time to time), among Belfius Commercial Finance, Belairbus SA, Sonaca, Asco Industries NV and BMT Eurair NV and for which Belfius Commercial Finance prior to Closing has not received payment from Airbus SE.

PURCHASE PRICE MECHANISM
3.1
Final Purchase Price
The purchase price for the Shares shall be equal to the Initial Purchase Price calculated in accordance with Clause 3.2, adjusted, as the case may be, with the amount of the Price Adjustment in accordance with Clause 3.3 (as so adjusted, the “Final Purchase Price”).
3.2
Initial Purchase Price
The initial purchase price for the Shares amounts to USD 420,000,000 (four hundred and twenty million US dollars), reflecting the Agreed Enterprise Value on a fully consolidated basis (the “Initial Purchase Price”). The Initial Purchase Price has been revised twice by the Parties (i.e., in their letter agreement dated March 19, 2019 and by means of their entry into this amended and restated version of the Agreement, effective October 28, 2019).

Price Adjustment

•
the Initial Purchase Price will be decreased by an amount equal to the Net Debt, converted into USD at the Best Estimate Spot Exchange Rate;
•
If the amount of Net Working Capital as at Closing exceeds the Net Working Capital Ceiling, the Initial Purchase Price will be increased by an amount equal to such excess, converted into USD at the Best Estimate Spot Exchange Rate;


Page 21 of 60

Execution Version



•
If the amount of Net Working Capital as at Closing is lower than the Net Working Capital Floor, the Initial Purchase Price will be decreased by an amount equal to such shortfall, converted into USD at the Best Estimate Spot Exchange Rate; and
•
The Initial Purchase Price will be decreased by the amount, to the extent not included in the calculation of Net Debt and converted into USD at the Best Estimate Spot Exchange Rate, of all liabilities of the Group (but not of the Purchaser or the Guarantor), resulting or arising from the Cyberattack, incurred (but not paid) prior to Closing (even if such liability will not become due until after the Closing, to the extent that such liability is certain and of a fixed amount as of the Closing (collectively, the “Cyber Adjustments”). The Cyber Adjustments shall include (but not be limited to):
i.
all costs for support from IT or other experts and advisors and measures taken or to be taken (i) to restore the IT systems and the operations of the Group and (ii) to mitigate the impact of the Cyberattack on the business activities of the Group in general, in each case up to the status that existed prior to the Cyberattack. For the avoidance of doubt, such costs do not include any costs incurred as a result of enhancing the IT systems and the operations of the Group, (i.e. costs relating to improving the network architecture from a security perspective, upgrading to a significantly enhanced system and network administration framework, and increased security monitoring and alerting, including advanced threat protection);
ii.
all liabilities of the Group towards the Group’s employees, consultants, customers, suppliers or third parties (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Airbus) or towards any Regulatory Authority, whether arising contractually, in connection with a Proceeding, or otherwise, resulting or arising from the Cyberattack or the suspension of its production as a result thereof or any costs or expenses (including legal fees) of the Group incurred in connection with the negotiation on and/or defence against such liabilities; and
iii.
all liabilities of the Group and loss of revenue of the Group resulting from or in relation to any amendment or termination of, or exercise of any rights under, any commercial agreement entered into by the Group or termination of any existing business relationship of the Group (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Airbus), in each case resulting or arising from the Cyberattack or the suspension of its production as a result thereof;
provided that (a) to the extent any of the Cyber Adjustments would be included in the calculation of Net Working Capital, they shall be disregarded for such purpose and shall instead be deducted from the Initial Purchase Price as a Cyber Adjustment and (b) the Initial Purchase Price shall be preliminarily adjusted on the Closing Date based on the pre-Closing best estimate of the Sellers of the Closing Accounts using the consolidated balance sheet of the Group as of December 31, 2019 (including for the avoidance of doubt the year-end adjustments that would be included if the Closing Date were a fiscal year-end) as a starting point for the analysis (the “Best Estimate”), acting reasonably, of the amounts set forth in Clause 3.3.1 and will be further adjusted post-Closing based on the amounts set forth in Clause 3.3.1 as at the Closing Date in accordance with Clause 3.3.2 based on the Closing Accounts with respect to such amounts. The Sellers will provide a draft of the

Page 22 of 60

Execution Version

Best Estimate ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing and take into consideration all reasonable comments of the Purchaser prior to Closing. The Price Adjustment shall initially be calculated in EUR and then converted into USD using the Best Estimate Spot Exchange Rate.
In addition, both the Closing Amount and any Post-Closing Adjustment to be paid to Sellers shall be converted to EUR at the Best Estimate Spot Exchange Rate and paid to Sellers in EUR.
3.3.2
Within one hundred eighty days (180) days of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause to be prepared an audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the year-end adjustments that would be included if the Closing Date were a fiscal year-end) as at Closing (without taking into account any circumstances resulting solely from the transactions contemplated hereby other than costs incurred as result of paying off the outstanding indebtedness of the Group and any outstanding financial instruments, listed in Schedule 5, up to a maximum amount of EUR 3,304,400 (three million three hundred four thousand four hundred euros), to be decreased by the related tax effect) and a statement calculating the adjustments referred to in Clause 3.3.1, prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP, applied consistently in accordance with prior years (provided that if the application in prior periods is not reconcilable with Belgian GAAP, then Belgian GAAP takes precedence) (collectively, the “Closing Accounts”). All underlying calculations shall be made in EUR; the resulting adjustments to Net Debt, Net Working Capital or the Cyber Adjustments, if any, shall be expressed in USD using the Best Estimate Spot Exchange Rate. The Purchaser shall provide details of any variance between the calculation of the Price Adjustment and the Final Purchase Price resulting therefrom based on the Closing Accounts and the Best Estimate. The Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Sellers’ Representative (for and on behalf of the Sellers) the Closing Accounts and the statement comprising the details of any variance between the Best Estimate and the calculation of the Price Adjustment and the Final Purchase Price resulting therefrom based on the Closing Accounts within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall, subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings being entered into, provide the Sellers’ Representative (and its advisors) reasonable access to all relevant documents, books, records and working papers used in preparation of the Closing Accounts or useful for verifying the Closing Accounts and the calculation of the Price Adjustment and the Final Purchase Price resulting therefrom, to the extent reasonably required for such review and will and shall cause the internal accounting personnel of the Group Companies to fully cooperate with and assist the Sellers’ Representative (and its advisors) with its review.

Execution Version

3.3.3
The Sellers’ Representative shall have sixty (60) Business Days from the date it receives the Closing Accounts to review the Closing Accounts, and to inform the Purchaser in writing of its disagreement (an “Objection”) with the Closing Accounts or the calculation of the Price Adjustment and the Final Purchase Price resulting therefrom based on the Closing Accounts, if any. If the Sellers’ Representative raises no Objection within such sixty (60) Business Day period, the Closing Accounts shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Sellers’ Representative (for and on behalf of the Sellers) and shall become binding upon the Sellers and the Purchaser. If the Sellers’ Representative delivers an Objection to the Purchaser within such sixty (60) Business Day period, the Purchaser and the Sellers’ Representative, for and on behalf of the Sellers, shall then attempt in good faith to resolve their disagreement(s) within thirty (30) Business Days from the time the Objection is received (the “Resolution Period”). If the Sellers’ Representative, for and on behalf of the Sellers, and the Purchaser are unable to resolve their disagreement(s) with respect to the Closing Accounts within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Auditor in accordance with Clause 3.4.
3.3.4
If the Closing Amount paid by the Purchaser to the Sellers at Closing is higher than the Final Adjusted Closing Amount, then the difference, converted into USD at the Best Estimate Spot Exchange Rate, shall be paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser through a distribution to the Purchaser by the Escrow Agent to the extent possible out of the Holdback Amount (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, from the Escrow Amount) promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Final Purchase Price as contemplated hereunder and from the Sellers, if the Holdback Amount is insufficient. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall take all actions and execute and deliver all documents to the Escrow Agent reasonably required pursuant to the Holdback Agreement to effect any release from the Holdback Account pursuant to the preceding sentence. If the Closing Amount paid by the Purchaser to the Sellers at Closing is lower than the Final Adjusted Closing Amount, then the difference shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Sellers promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Final Purchase Price as contemplated hereunder. Any amount paid pursuant to this Clause 3.3.4 shall be referred to a “Post-Closing Adjustment”.
3.3.5
If all or any portion of the Holdback Amount is not distributed to the Purchaser by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Clause 3.3.4 (whether because the Final Adjusted Closing Amount exceeded the Closing Amount or because the Closing Amount exceeded the Final Adjusted Closing Amount by an amount less than the Holdback Amount), then the Sellers and the Purchaser shall take all actions and execute and deliver all documents to the Escrow Agent reasonably required pursuant to the Holdback Agreement to effect the distribution by the Escrow Agent of the remainder of the Holdback Amount from the Holdback Account to the Escrow Account and such funds shall thereafter be included in the Escrow Amount and shall be available for the satisfaction of Claims pursuant to Clause 8, subject to the limitations of Clause 9.

Independent Auditor
3.4.1.

In doing so, the Independent Auditor shall perform a mission within the meaning of section 1592 of the Belgian Civil Code. The Independent Auditor shall be requested to make its decision on the matters in dispute (excluding any other items) within twenty (20) Business Days of confirmation and acknowledgement by the Independent Auditor of its appointment.
3.4.2.
The Independent Auditor shall act on the following basis:
•
the Independent Auditor shall determine the procedure to be followed in deciding the matter, it being understood that it shall allow the Parties to make written statements on the disputed matter;
•
the Seller and the Purchaser shall each provide (and to the extent they are reasonably able to do so, shall procure that their respective accountants, employees or advisors provide) the Independent Auditor promptly with all information which it reasonably requires and the Independent Auditor shall be entitled (to the extent considered appropriate by it) to base its opinion on such information and on the accounting and other records of the Company;
•
in connection with an engagement pursuant to Clause 3.3.3, the Independent Auditor shall determine values of Net Debt and Net Working Capital within the range presented by the Parties, applying the definitions of Net Debt and Net Working Capital as set out in this Agreement and calculated in accordance with Schedule 6 and Schedule 7 respectively; and
•
the decision of the Independent Auditor shall (in the absence of manifest error or manifest breach of the principles set out in this Agreement) be final and binding upon the Parties.
3.4.3.
In connection with an engagement pursuant to Clause 3.3.3, the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne by the Parties in the same proportion as the aggregate amount of the disputed matters submitted to the Independent Auditor bears to the matters successfully disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Independent Auditor) or in such other proportions as the Independent Auditor shall determine.

4.1.1
there not being in effect on the Closing Date any (executive) order or judgment enacted or issued by a Regulatory Authority or court of competent jurisdiction restricting the Closing of the envisaged Transaction, it being understood that the Purchaser and Guarantor have waived this condition precedent to the extent as set forth in the letter agreement between the Parties dated March 19, 2019; and
4.1.2
the Regulatory Authorities of the European Union and of the United States of America competent to grant clearance to the Transaction having issued a clearance decision in compliance with the applicable Antitrust Laws (either unconditionally or under conditions acceptable to the Purchaser in accordance with Clause 4.4.4), or the relevant periods after filing a complete notification having expired without the relevant Regulatory Authority issuing a decision with the result that the relevant Regulatory Authority is deemed, under the applicable Antitrust Laws, to have granted approval of the Transaction (the “Competition Condition”). For the avoidance of doubt and consistent with the Letter Agreement between the Parties dated March 19, 2019, the Competition Condition shall only be satisfied with respect to the European Union to the extent that the European Commission has (a) issued a clearance decision for the Transaction under conditions materially in line with those offered by Guarantor and Asco in the Commitments and (b) granted approval under paragraph 7(c) of those Commitments.
4.2.
Conditions to the Obligations of the Purchaser
In addition to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Clause 4.1, the obligations of the Purchaser to complete the Transaction are further subject to the fulfilment of each of the following conditions precedent (together with the conditions precedent set forth in Clause 4.1, the “Conditions Precedent”) on or before 9 a.m. (CET) on the Long Stop Date:
4.2.1
the profit certificates issued by Asco Industries NV to the benefit of FPIM NV / SFPI SA having been fully and finally purchased by the Company (the price being paid therefore and any other taxes, withholdings to be made, costs or expenses incurred as a result thereof being treated as a Net Debt item to the extent not already paid at the latest on Closing) and there shall be no further right for FPIM NV / SFPI SA nor any further obligation on the Group Companies towards FPIM NV / SFPI SA further to such profit certificates or the purchase agreement following such purchase (the “FPIM Condition”), it being understood that the Parties acknowledge that FPIM NV / SFPI SA and the Company have already agreed to such purchase under the condition precedent of Closing, so that the FPIM Condition is to be considered as satisfied for purposes of determining when Closing shall take place in accordance with Clause 5; and



Page 26 of 60

Execution Version

4.2.2
with respect to the change of control clauses included in the commercial agreements listed in Schedule 11, third party consent to the change of control or a waiver by the third party of the benefit of the change of control clauses having been obtained by the Parties, it being understood that the Purchaser has partially waived the fulfilment of this condition precedent in the letter agreement between the Parties dated March 19, 2019, by limiting it to Airbus SE, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, having provided its consent to the Transaction, as the case may be by means of a consent provided by Airbus SAS and Airbus Military SL.
4.3.
Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent
4.3.1.
The Parties shall (and, to the extent applicable, the Sellers shall cause the Group Companies to) use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts (save with respect to the Competition Condition, where Clause 4.4 hereafter will apply) to ensure that the Conditions Precedent are satisfied as soon as reasonably practicable and on the Long Stop Date at the latest. Notwithstanding section 1179 of the Belgian Civil Code, the fulfilment of the Conditions Precedent set out in Clause 4.1 shall have no retroactive effect regarding this Agreement.
4.3.2.
Where any Condition Precedent is capable of being waived (in whole or in part), the Parties may jointly (or, with respect to a Condition Precedent set out in Clauses 4.2.1 or 4.2.2, the Purchaser may) waive in writing that Condition Precedent at any time on or before the Closing Date and that Condition Precedent (or, where applicable, that part of it) will be deemed to have been satisfied by such waiver.
4.4.
Conduct of Competition filing
4.4.1.
After execution of this Agreement the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for obtaining all consents, approvals, clearances, waivers or actions of the Regulatory Authorities required under applicable Antitrust Law to be made or obtained necessary to fulfil the Competition Condition as soon as possible.

4.4.2.
The Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers in advance of any notification, submission, response or other communication which it proposes to make or submit to any Regulatory Authorities pursuant to Clause 4.4.1 (including, but not limited to the submission of pre-notifications, appearances, presentations, memoranda, definitive filings and any proposed understandings, undertakings or agreements with the Regulatory Authorities) and at the same time provide the Sellers with drafts and copies thereof and any supporting documentation or information reasonably requested by the Sellers, it being understood that such copies or documentation may be redacted in order to avoid the communication of business secrets of the Purchaser. The Purchaser undertakes to take due consideration of any reasonable comments which the Sellers may have and to use its reasonable efforts to provide the Sellers with sufficient time to make such comments.



Page 27 of 60

Execution Version

4.4.3.
The Purchaser agrees to keep the Sellers fully informed as to the progress of any enquiry by the Regulatory Authorities in the context of the Competition Condition.
4.4.4.
Where necessary to remove any impediments, restrictions, or conditions that prevent the fulfilment of the Competition Condition, the Purchaser agrees to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to offer and agrees to accept, in each of such jurisdictions, any remedies that are required to obtain such competition clearance that do not adversely impact the economic value of the Transaction to Purchaser (other than impacts that in the aggregate only have a De Minimis economic impact), it being stipulated for the avoidance of doubt that any remedy that includes a divestiture of any assets of the Group or the Purchaser’s Group shall be deemed to have a more than De Minimis economic impact. In this view and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, as soon as any Regulatory Authority reasonably expresses, formally or informally to Purchaser, any concerns about the impact of the Transaction, the Purchaser shall promptly inform the Sellers and their legal advisors and keep them informed in advance of the measures that the Purchaser is considering to take, or the commitments that it is considering to propose, in order to resolve these concerns as the case may be.
4.5.
Notification of satisfaction of Conditions Precedent
4.5.1.

The Sellers shall notify the Purchaser immediately upon and not later than one (1) Business Day after becoming aware of any (executive) order or judgment restricting the Closing of the envisaged Transaction as set out in Clause 4.1.1.
4.5.3.
The Purchaser shall, in reliance on the information provided by the Group Companies and the Sellers, investigate and decide whether the proposed Transaction will have to be notified to any Regulatory Authority in accordance with applicable Antitrust Law, and the Purchaser will be solely liable (subject to the immediately following sentence), including vis-à-vis the Sellers, for any liabilities or fines resulting from the lack of notification, the late notification and/or the lack of clearance in any jurisdiction, subject to the Sellers, in accordance with their undertaking in Clause 4.4.1, having reasonably cooperated with, and having caused the Group Companies to reasonably cooperate with, the Purchaser by providing all reasonably required information to the extent reasonably able to produce and assisting the Purchaser in making its proper analysis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the analysis of the Purchaser is based on information provided by the Group Companies or the Sellers, the Sellers shall be liable vis-à-vis the Purchaser for any damage resulting from such information being materially incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete.

Provided that the Conditions Precedent are not all waived or satisfied in accordance with this Agreement within such five (5) Business Days’ notice period, this Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of such five (5) Business Days period.

Such termination shall occur without any liability of any Party to the other Party, provided the fact that a Condition Precedent has not been satisfied does not result from a breach of a Party’s obligations under this Clause 4 (in which case such Party will become liable towards the other Party).

Execution Version

6.6.3
As part of the assessment above, the Parties shall work together to address the Cyberattack’s impact on the Group’s financial systems and financial controls, with a view to providing the Purchaser to the extent possible with adequate answers, prior the Closing, to the questions set out in Schedule 14, that shall serve as a basis for such analysis. The Purchaser acknowledges that, in view of the limited resources available within the Group (a.o. because the Group Companies’ employees necessary are heavily involved in (i) Cyberattack remediation workstreams, (ii) the year end closings and related financial reporting and (iii) Closing workstreams, along with their existing day-to-day tasks), such impact analysis will be limited to what is strictly required for the ability of the Purchaser to comply with its financial reporting obligations immediately post Closing.
6.6.4
Prior to Closing, the Sellers shall engage in continued dialogue with the Purchaser regarding efforts to restore the IT systems and the operations of the Group and to mitigate the impact of the Cyberattack on the business activities of the Group and the effects of the Cyberattack on (i) Asco’s IT systems and the operations of the Group and (ii) on the business activities of the Group in general, in each case up to the status that existed prior to the Cyberattack as provided in Clause 3.3.1. The Sellers shall cause the Group Companies to implement the Purchaser’s reasonable suggestions in connection with such remediation efforts, provided, however, (a) that such suggestions shall not violate the Commitments or Sonaca Protocol and (b) the costs incurred by the Sellers for any products or services as a result of such reasonable suggestions that are certain and of a fixed amount as of the Closing shall, if unpaid prior to Closing, be included in the Cyber Adjustments.
6.6.5
The Sellers’ obligations pursuant to Clauses 6.6.1 through 6.6.4 shall not require the Sellers or the Group Companies to provide any information to the Purchaser, the Guarantor or their advisors, or allow the Purchaser, the Guarantor or their advisors to access any information, to the extent that the providing or allowing access to such information would violate applicable Law, including Antitrust Laws, in each case unless appropriate protective measures have been taken (for example, by entering into clean team arrangements). The Parties agree to enter into any clean team arrangements necessary in order to comply with Clauses 6.6.1 through 6.6.4.
6.7
Airbus Claims
Prior to the Closing, the Sellers’ Representative and certain representatives of the Guarantor shall use their reasonable best efforts to meet with representatives of Airbus to discuss, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, including Antitrust Laws, whether Airbus intends to assert any claims against the Group and/or the Purchaser with respect to liabilities resulting or arising from a termination or default under any agreement due to the Cyberattack or the suspension of the Group’s production as a result thereof, or whether Airbus intends to terminate or exercise any rights under any commercial agreement entered into with the Group, or terminate of any existing business relationship with the Group, in each case arising or resulting from the Cyberattack or the suspension of the Group’s production as a result thereof.

(collectively, the “Interim Financial Statements”).
6.8.2
The 2018 Financial Statements and the 2019 Financial Statements (including the related notes and schedules thereto, when available) provided to the Purchaser pursuant to Clause 6.8.1 shall have been prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP and the valuation rules applied to the consolidated audited annual accounts of the Company for the financial year ending on December 31, 2017 (with the exception of any valuation rules that have changed for reasons as communicated in writing to the Purchaser) and present a true and fair view of the financial position, assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Group for the periods set forth therein, in each case consistently applied in accordance with Belgian GAAP during the periods involved.

SELLERS’ WARRANTIES
7.1
The Sellers represent and warrant to the Purchaser that the statements set out in Schedule 2 (the “Sellers’ Representations and Warranties”) are true and accurate on the Signing Date or on any such earlier date as of which any Sellers’ Representation or Warranty is expressly made.
7.2
The Sellers represent and warrant to the Purchaser that the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties shall be true and accurate in all material respects on the Closing Date or on any such earlier date as of which any Sellers’ Representation or Warranty is expressly made.
7.3
Without prejudice to Clause 25.1 and 25.2, the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties are the only representations or assurances of any kind given by or on behalf of the Sellers and collectively and exhaustively reflect characteristics that the Purchaser may reasonably expect the Shares, the Group and its business to have. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it has not entered into this Agreement in reliance on any representation or warranty other than the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties and other than with respect to the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties waives to the fullest extent possible or permitted under any applicable Law all rights and remedies which might otherwise be available to it in respect of any such representations, warranties, other assurances, statements, promises or forecasts (whether written or oral).
7.4
In no event are any representations or warranties, express or implied, given by the Sellers with respect to forecasts, plans, expectations, the feasibility of any business plans or the future development of the business of any Group Company and, more broadly, to any fact, circumstance or event dated after the Signing Date (other than with respect to the accuracy of the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties as of the Closing Date in Clause 7.2), or as the case may be, any such earlier date as of which any of the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties is expressly made, irrespective of whether these have been explicitly included in any disclosed document or information.
7.5
The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it has performed, with the assistance of professional advisors, an extensive due diligence investigation with respect to the Shares, the Group Companies and their respective businesses, activities, operation, assets, liabilities and financial condition during the period from 8 November 2017 until the Signing Date on the basis of the information provided by the Sellers and their advisers - amongst others - by way of data room documents in the Data Room, management presentations and expert calls and the related Q&A process (the “Due Diligence Investigation”). The Purchaser acknowledges that the Due Diligence Investigation was in a form, scope and substance to the Purchaser’s satisfaction and that it has raised with the Sellers any and all specific issues which it considered relevant in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and obtained satisfactory answers from the Sellers on all its queries.



Page 38 of 60

Execution Version

7.6
The information contained in the Data Room (an index of which is included in Schedule 3), this Agreement including the Schedules hereto, the Information Memorandum and the written answers to questions raised by the Purchaser and its advisors (copies of which are also included in Schedule 3), any other information made available to the Purchaser and its advisors in writing, in interviews, in process letters, in (management or other) presentations (written records of these interviews; process letters and (management or other) presentations are also included in Schedule 3) or in any other form, and all other information which is in the public domain in each case as of the Signing Date shall together be considered the disclosed information (the “Disclosed Information”).
8
INDEMNIFICATION
8.1
The Sellers shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser harmless from and against any Damage resulting from a breach of any of the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties or Clause 6.8.2 (a “Breach”), it being understood that (without prejudice to Clause 9.11) (i) for purposes of computing the amount of any Damage indemnifiable to the Purchaser, both the Damages suffered by the Damages suffered by the Purchaser and/or any Group Company (as if they had been incurred by the Purchaser, but without duplication) shall be taken into account, (ii) any Damage incurred by a Group Company shall be deemed to be incurred by the Purchaser in the same amount, multiplied by the percentage of the (direct or indirect) shareholding of the Purchaser in the relevant Group Company acquired in the framework of this Transaction (save with respect to ASCO Finance USA NV, where the percentage shall deemed to be 100 %) and maintained up to the moment the Damages are finally determined, either by mutual agreement among the Parties or in a final, non-appealable decision in accordance with Clause 26.
It is thus specified for the avoidance of doubt that the Sellers thus covenant to indemnify the Purchaser for any Breach up to the amount as is required to put the Purchaser and/or the Group Companies (if the Damages would have been indemnifiable to the Group Companies) into the position that it and/or the Group Companies would have been in, had the Breach not occurred (save for any difference that may result from the application of the Spot Exchange Rate, if relevant).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it is not entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this Clause 8 in relation to the termination of the A380 program by Airbus and, to the extent applicable, waives any rights in that respect it might have.
8.2
In the event of a Breach the Purchaser shall submit to the Sellers a claim for compensation (a “Claim”).
8.3
The Purchaser shall, after discovery of the circumstances giving rise to such Claim, promptly and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date on which the Purchaser becomes aware or should have become aware of the relevant fact, circumstance or matter, notify the Sellers giving such particulars of the underlying facts as may reasonably be required for a normally prudent seller to be able to understand the Claim and assess it on its merits to the extent then available (a “Claim Notice”). The Claim must also set out in reasonable detail the fact, circumstance or matter giving rise to the Claim and the relevant provisions of this Agreement on which it is based, and specify the Purchaser’s best estimate of its likely

Page 39 of 60

Execution Version

amount to the extent then available. Failure to comply with any of the requirements set forth in this Clause 8.3 shall not result in the Purchaser forfeiting its right to claim Damages for a Breach, but limit such right to the extent the liability of the Sellers would have been increased as a result thereof.
8.4
The Sellers will respond to the Claim Notice (a “Claim Response”) within twenty (20) Business Days (the “Response Period”) after the date that the Claim Notice is given.
8.5
In connection with any Claim made by the Purchaser against the Sellers, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group Companies, to make available to the Sellers on an ongoing basis all such information as the Sellers may reasonably require for assessing, disputing, resisting, appealing, compromising, defending, remedying or mitigating the Claim. If and to the extent reasonably required for the purposes of assessing, disputing, resisting, appealing, compromising, defending, remedying or mitigating the Claim, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group Companies, to grant reasonable access to the Group Companies’ management and premises, provided that the obligations of the Purchaser under this Clause 8.5 are limited to information required for the Sellers’ defence under the Claim (as the case may be a third party claim).
8.6
If the Sellers dispute the Claim, the Parties will meet promptly to try to amicably resolve the Claim. If the Parties fail to amicably resolve the Claim within twenty (20) Business Days of the Claim Response, then the Claim will be considered unresolved and will be resolved in accordance with Clause 26. The Purchaser will have until the later of (i) sixty (60) Business Days after giving the Claim Notice and (ii) two (2) years after the Closing Date to submit the Claim to arbitration in accordance with Clause 26. If the Purchaser fails to submit the Claim to arbitration within this period, the Claim will be deemed dismissed and resolved, and will not be thereafter reasserted.
8.7
If the Sellers elect not to dispute a Claim described in a Claim Notice, whether by failing to give a timely Claim Response or otherwise, then the Sellers will be deemed to have agreed to pay the amount of such Claim to the Purchaser. The Escrow Agent shall release such amount from the Escrow Amount to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and to the extent that such Escrow Amount is not sufficient to satisfy the Claim, then the Sellers shall promptly pay such required balance of such Claim to the Purchaser.
8.8
If any amount is to be released from the Escrow Account to the Purchaser in respect of Damages incurred in EUR, in order to determine the amount of USD to be released from the Escrow Account, such Damages will converted to USD at the relevant Spot Exchange Rate. If any Seller is to make a payment directly (as opposed to through a release of funds from the Escrow Account) to the Purchaser pursuant to such Seller’s indemnification obligations under this Agreement, such payment shall be made in the currency of the relevant Damages incurred by the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company.



Page 40 of 60

Execution Version

8.9
Any payment made by a Seller in respect of a Breach shall be deemed to be a reduction of the part of the Final Purchase Price that such Seller has received hereunder.
8.10
The Purchaser acknowledges that the right to claim indemnification in accordance with this Clause 8 (subject to the limitations set out in this Agreement) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser in respect of any Breach under this Agreement. The Purchaser expressly and irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all rights and remedies it might have under Belgian law or otherwise in respect of any Breach, including the right to seek the termination of this Agreement in court (at any time, including after Closing) pursuant to section 1184 of the Belgian Civil Code.
8.11
If the receipt of any amount of Damages results in an effective Tax payment by the Purchaser, the amount payable shall be grossed up by such amount as will ensure that after effective payment of such Tax there shall be left a sum equal to the amount which would otherwise be payable, it being understood that if at the time of payment of the Damages the exact amount of such Taxes cannot be determined, the Parties shall take into account a fair estimate of such Taxes in order to determine the amount of Damages. Such estimate shall be adjusted as soon as the actual amount of Taxes has been determined and paid.
8.12
The Sellers and the Purchaser shall take all actions and execute and deliver all documents to the Escrow Agent reasonably required pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to effect any release from the Escrow Account contemplated by this Agreement.
9
LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION
9.1
Disclosure
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall not be in Breach (as defined above), and shall not be liable in respect of any Breach to the extent that, at Signing, the Purchaser was or should have been aware of such Breach, because the facts and circumstances giving rise thereto:
9.1.1
were Fairly Disclosed to the Purchaser on the basis of the Disclosed Information; or
9.1.2
have been Fairly Disclosed, or excepted, in the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties themselves and/or otherwise in this Agreement and/or in the schedules hereto.

9.2
Minimum claims and basket
9.2.1
No indemnification shall be due for any individual Breach in respect of which the amount of the Damages to which the Purchaser would otherwise be entitled is less than USD 100,000 (USD hundred thousand); provided, that, for the purpose of determining if such threshold is exceeded, Damages incurred in EUR shall be converted into USD at the relevant Spot Exchange Rate. Claims arising from similar related facts, matters or circumstances shall be aggregated for the purposes of this Clause 9.2.1.
9.2.2
The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover any Damages in respect of any Breach unless the aggregate amount of Damages in respect of all Breaches for which indemnification is owed exceeds USD 1,000,000 (USD one million); provided, that, for the purpose of determining if such threshold is exceeded, Damages incurred in EUR shall be converted into USD at the relevant Spot Exchange Rate (the “Basket”), it being understood that (i) in case the Basket is exceeded the full amount shall be due including the amount of the Basket and (ii) Breaches for which the Sellers are not held to indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to Clause 9.2.1 are not taken into account to calculate the Basket.
9.3
Maximum liability
The maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers under this Agreement shall not exceed USD 80,000,000 (USD eighty million) (the “Overall Indemnification Cap”); provided, that, for the purpose of determining if such threshold is exceeded, Damages incurred in EUR shall be converted into USD at the relevant Spot Exchange Rate; and provided, further, that the Overall Indemnification Cap shall not apply to any liability pursuant to Clause 10.1(H) if the Overall Indemnification Cap has been exceeded. For the avoidance of doubt, any liability of the Sellers pursuant to Clause 10.1(H) shall be taken into account to determine whether the Overall Indemnification Cap has been exceeded, and if so, the Sellers shall only be held liable under this Agreement for any liability pursuant to Clause 10.1(H).
9.4
Time limitations
Without prejudice to Clause 8.3, the Sellers shall not be in Breach (as defined above), and shall not be liable in respect of any Breach unless a Claim is given:
9.4.1
for all Breaches other than for Breaches of the Title Warranties and the Tax Warranties, two (2) years after Closing;
9.4.2
for Breaches of the Title Warranties, ten (10) years and three (3) months after Closing; and
9.4.3
for Breaches of the Tax Warranties, before or on the date on which the matter giving rise to the Claim is barred by applicable statute of limitation increased with three (3) months.

The Sellers shall have no obligation to reimburse Damages to the Purchaser in respect of any liability which is contingent (“voorwaardelijke of latente verbintenis” / “obligation conditionnelle ou éventuelle”) unless and until such contingent liability has become an actual liability and is due and payable, provided, however, that this Clause 9.5 shall not have the effect of preventing the Purchaser from validly making a Claim in respect of a contingent liability within the time limit specified in Clause 9.4, even though it has not become an actual liability. For the avoidance of doubt, any Claim may validly be made in respect of a contingent liability if and only if (and to the extent only that) the Purchaser (i) has a present (but not yet due and payable) obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and (ii) it is probable (i.e., more likely than not) that an outflow of economic resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. To the extent reasonably possible at the time of making the Claim, the Purchaser shall include therein an estimate of the amount of the Damages, provided that the amount thus set forth shall not operate as a limitation on the right of the Purchaser to subsequently be indemnified for all Damages, even if higher.
9.6
Provisions for liabilities
The Sellers shall have no obligation to reimburse Damages to the Purchaser in respect of any Claim if and to the extent that the matter giving rise to the Claim is accounted or provided for in the Closing Accounts and was reflected in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price.
9.7
Insurance proceeds and recoveries from third parties
9.7.1
The Sellers shall have no obligation to reimburse the Purchaser in respect of any Claim if and to the extent that the Damages in respect of which the Claim is made (i) are covered by an insurance policy in force at the level of a Group Company at the Closing Date, (ii) would have been covered if such an insurance policy had been maintained beyond the Closing Date or (iii) are effectively recovered from any other third party.
9.7.2
The Purchaser shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain recovery in respect of any Damages from any third party indemnity which is available in respect of Damages as soon as possible. If the Purchaser receives such proceeds or indemnification recovery in connection with Damages for which it has been indemnified hereunder, the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers and refund to the Sellers the amount of such proceeds or indemnification recoveries when received.
9.8
Tax Savings
9.8.1
Any amount owed by the Sellers in respect of any Claim shall be reduced by the amount of any Tax Savings for the relevant Group Company arising from the Damages in respect of which the Claim has been made.

Execution Version


9.8.2
If the amount of the Tax Savings is determined after payment by the Sellers of any amount in discharge of the Claim, the Purchaser shall pay, or shall procure that the relevant Group Company pays, to the Sellers an amount equal to the difference between:
i.
the amount paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser; and
ii.
the amount that the Purchaser would have received if such Tax Savings had been taken into account in determining the amount due by the Sellers in accordance with this Clause 9.8.
9.8.3
For the purposes of this Clause 9.8, “Tax Savings” means the amount by which any Tax for which the relevant Group Company would otherwise have been liable is or could in the future be reduced as a result of such Damage.
9.9
Changes in Laws and practice
The Seller shall not be liable in respect of a Claim to the extent that the Claim arises or is increased as a result of:
9.9.1
any change in GAAP applicable to the relevant Group Company after the Closing Date;
9.9.2
any change in the accounting policies or practice of the Purchaser’s Group or of a Group Company after the Closing Date, save where such change was required to remedy an illegality existing prior to Closing;
9.9.3
the passing of any Laws, or making of any subordinate Laws after the Closing Date; or
9.9.4
any change in the interpretation or application of any Laws or in the (administrative) practice after the Closing Date of any Regulatory Authority, including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, the application of the Tax Laws.
9.10
Matters arising subsequent to Closing
The Sellers shall have no obligation to reimburse Damages to the Purchaser in respect of any Damages to the extent that the same would not have occurred but for any action or omission of a Group Company, the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser, after Closing, nor in respect of any Damages resulting from or triggered by any investigation or claim initiated following any initiative taken by a Group Company, the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser, after the Closing Date, unless such action, initiative or omission is an action, initiative or omission which a similarly situated internationally active industrial buyer, whether or not listed, engaging in a transaction of size and nature as the Transaction would as shareholder of the Group Companies undertake or omit to undertake or cause the Group Companies to undertake or omit to undertake with due regard for the interests of such buyer as shareholder in preserving the value of its investment in the Group Companies and their assets.

9.11
No cumulation (non bis in idem)
If the same Damages can give rise to a Claim under several provisions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall only be required to reimburse such Damages once, subject to the limitations set out herein.
9.12
Mitigation
Without prejudice to section 1134, para. 3 of the Belgian Civil Code, the Purchaser shall procure that all reasonable steps are taken to avoid or mitigate any Damages which might give rise to a Claim against the Sellers.
9.13
Absence of Limitation of Liability
None of the limitations contained in Clause 9 (other than Clause 9.11) shall apply to and the Purchaser shall be entitled to full indemnification for any Damage resulting from any Breach which is the consequence of fraud (“dol” / “bedrog”) or wilful misconduct (“opzet” / “faute intentionelle”) by the Sellers or is the consequence of fraud (“dol” / “bedrog”) or wilful misconduct (“opzet” / “faute intentionelle”) by the Group Companies which was known to the Sellers at the Signing Date and not Fairly Disclosed to the Purchaser prior to the Signing Date, it being understood that in determining the amount of Damages due regard shall nevertheless be given to any insurance proceeds, recoveries from third parties and/or tax savings that would be unaffected by the foregoing.
10
SPECIFIC INDEMNITY
10.1
General
The Sellers agree to fully indemnify and hold the Purchaser harmless for any and all Damages incurred by the Purchaser and/or the Group Companies in respect thereof, resulting or arising from, to the extent not taken into account in the calculation of Net Working Capital or Net Debt:
A.
(i) any and all Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Group Companies, or for which any of the Group Companies may otherwise be liable, for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending at Closing, (ii) any and all Taxes of any other person for which any of the Group Companies is or has been liable as a transferee or successor, where such liability results from circumstances existing prior to the Closing, and (iii) any obligation or other liability of any of the Group Companies to indemnify any other person in respect of or relating to Taxes or for any amounts calculated by reference to Taxes or to pay an amount pursuant to any Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreement entered into prior to the Closing Date (other than any such agreement solely among the Group Companies or that was entered into in the ordinary course of business and the principal purpose of which does not relate to Taxes);

C.
the claims referred to in Schedule 12;
D.
the fact that the provision accounted for in accounts no. 459620 and 459630 of Asco Industries NV/SA is insufficient to cover the risk for which it has been reserved up to Closing;
E.
the operations of Asco Brazil;
F.
(i) violations of certain transfer restrictions under foreign trade law committed by Asco Deutschland GmbH, as described in a voluntary self-denunciation declaration made by Asco Deutschland GmbH to the central custom office Gießen (Hauptzollamt Gießen) and (ii) the confirmation included in note 1.0 included in the Non-VDR USB Stick not being true and accurate;
G.
the Cyberattack (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any additional Damages incurred by the Group following Closing with respect to matters that were taken into account for purposes of calculating the Cyber Adjustments), but only to the extent such Damages have not been taken into account for purposes of determining the Price Adjustment in accordance with Clause 3.3.1; and
H.
the termination of any agreement between Airbus and any Group Company due to the Cyberattack, but only to the extent such Damages have not been taken into account for purposes of determining the Price Adjustment in accordance with Clause 3.3.1.

11
THIRD PARTY CLAIMS
11.1
Without prejudice to Clause 8.3, where a Claim of the Purchaser is based upon or relates to a claim by or a liability to a third party (a “Third Party Claim”), the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers of such Third Party Claim within five (5) Business Days after such Third Party Claim has been made, or sooner if this is reasonably required in order to properly prepare the defence against such Third Party Claim or if urgent actions may be required. Failure to comply with any of the requirements set forth in this Clause 11.1 shall not result in the Purchaser forfeiting its right to claim Damages for a Breach, but limit such right to the extent the liability of the Sellers would have been increased as a result thereof.
11.2
The Purchaser shall, or shall cause the relevant Group Company to, provide the Sellers with copies of all documents and correspondence from that third party, and all other documents and correspondence relating to the Third Party Claim as the Sellers may reasonably request, it being understood that the Sellers hereby agree (i) to keep all such information and documents confidential during a three (3) year period as of the receipt

Page 47 of 60

Execution Version

thereof, and (ii) to use such information only for the purpose of dealing with the Third Party Claim and the impact thereof on this Agreement.
11.3
The Sellers shall promptly and not later than twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim notify to the Purchaser: (i) whether they dispute the Purchaser’s or the relevant Group Company’s right to indemnification from the Sellers with respect to such Third Party Claim; and (ii) if they do not dispute such right of indemnification, whether or not they desire to defend the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company against such Third Party Claim.
11.4
Notwithstanding the above notice periods, the Purchaser is allowed to take any reasonable provisional measures, to the extent necessary, subject to informing the Sellers promptly thereof.
11.5
If, within the 20 (twenty) Business Days’ period provided for under Clause 11.2, the Sellers notify the Purchaser that they do not dispute the Purchaser’s right to indemnification and desire to defend the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company against such Third Party Claim, the Sellers shall have the right to assume and control the defence of such Third Party Claim by appropriate proceedings with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser at the Sellers’ sole cost and expense; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the resolution of such Third Party Claim could have a material impact on Guarantor’s reputation or materially interfere with Guarantor’s business or its relationships with its key customers, the Sellers shall not have the right to assume the control and defence of such Third Party Claim, subject to any increase in the amount of Damages indemnifiable by the Sellers further to this Agreement as a result of such defence to the extent it would be different from the defence that would have been pursued by the Sellers, being disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of Damages indemnifiable. The Purchaser’s approval of counsel proposed by the Sellers shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Purchaser may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in, but not control, any such defence or settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to claims related to the matters listed in Schedule 12, the Purchaser and Christian Boas shall jointly control and direct the defence of such claims, it being understood that they shall, acting reasonably, (i) jointly select counsel with respect to each such claim and (ii) actively consult and cooperate with each other in directing the defence of such claims.
11.6
If the Sellers:
1.dispute the Purchaser’s right to compensation with respect to a Third Party Claim; or
2.do not dispute such right to compensation but prefer not to assume the defence of such Third Party Claim; or



Page 48 of 60

Execution Version

3.do not react within twenty (20) Business Days to the Purchaser’s notification, and within ten (10) Business days after a second notice by the Purchaser, after expiration of said initial period, asserting the Purchaser’s intention to assume control of the legal defence of the Third Party Claim if the Sellers do not respond; or
4.do not dispute such right to compensation but fail to timely assume and prosecute the defence of such Third Party Claim;
then the Purchaser shall assume and control the defence of such Third Party Claim, provided that the Sellers shall have the right to assume the defence against a Third Party Claim, if at any time the Purchaser is not conducting the defence against such Third Party Claim in a reasonably diligent manner.
11.7
The Party responsible for the defence of any Third Party Claim (the “Responsible Party”) shall, to the extent reasonably requested by the other Parties, keep informed and, when appropriate, consult with the other Parties, on the status of any Third Party Claim for which such Party is not the Responsible Party, including, without limitation, all proposed settlement negotiations. With respect to a Third Party Claim for which the Sellers are the Responsible Party, the Purchaser shall make or cause the relevant Group Company to make available to the Sellers and their representatives all books and records relating to such Third Party Claim and shall render to the Sellers such assistance and access to the relevant Group Company as may be necessary or useful for purposes of the defence, as provided in this Clause 11.
11.8
The Responsible Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of each settlement offer (including whether the Responsible Party is willing or not to accept the proposed settlement offer) with respect to a Third Party Claim. The other Parties agree to notify the Responsible Party in due course whether or not such Parties are willing to accept the proposed settlement offer. The Responsible Party shall not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
11.9
If the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company does not consent to any settlement offer of a Third Party Claim (whether or not the Purchaser is the Responsible Party) that the Sellers agree to take responsibility for, the Purchaser or such Group Company may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such event, the maximum liability of the Seller with respect to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the full amount of such settlement offer.
11.10
If the Sellers do not consent to any settlement offer of a Third Party Claim (whether or not the Sellers are the Responsible Party with respect to such Third Party Claim), the Sellers may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such event, the Sellers shall be liable to the Purchaser for the full amount of the Damage sustained by the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company as a result of such Third Party Claim (without prejudice, for the avoidance of doubt, to the limitations set forth in Clause 9, which continue to apply).

ASSIGNMENTS
The Purchaser may not assign any of its rights, including the benefit of the Sellers’ Representations and Warranties, or transfer any of the obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Sellers.
Notwithstanding the above, but without prejudice to Clause 16, the Purchaser may subject to informing the Sellers thereof, assign (in whole or in part) the benefit of this Agreement to any member of the Purchaser’s Group, subject to such assignment not resulting in greater liability or additional obligations nor less rights for the Sellers under this Agreement. The Purchaser shall ensure that before any such assignee subsequently ceases to be a member of the Purchaser’s Group it shall re-assign that benefit to the Purchaser or to another continuing member of the Purchaser’s Group.
22
PAYMENTS
Save as otherwise specifically set out in this Agreement, if a Party defaults in the payment when due of any sum payable under this Agreement, it shall pay interest at an annual rate of three per cent (300 basis points) above EURIBOR three months (it being understood that if and to the extent the EURIBOR three months would be negative, it shall for purposes of this Agreement be considered as being equal to zero) on that sum from the date on which payment is due until the date of actual payment, which interest shall accrue from day to day, without the need for any specific notice, and be compounded annually.
23
NATURE OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLERS
23.1
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the Sellers undertakes individually, for itself, the applicable obligations set forth in this Agreement and each of the Sellers may individually for itself enforce all its rights under this Agreement.
23.2
Further to Clause 23.1 above, where any obligation, representation, warranty or undertaking in this Agreement is expressed to be made, undertaken or given by the Sellers they shall be severally, not jointly, responsible in respect of it, in proportion to their respective holdings of Shares immediately before Closing as set out in Schedule 1. For the avoidance of doubt, no Seller can be held liable for a Breach by another Seller, save with respect to the obligation to deliver the Shares upon Closing.
24
COSTS AND EXPENSES
Each Party will pay the costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the entering into, and completion of, this Agreement, including, without limitation, in respect of their obligations in satisfying the Conditions Precedent and the other requirements for transferring the Shares.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Execution Version

25.2
Save as explicitly provided in this Agreement, the Parties waive their rights, if any and whether in whole or in part, to annul, rescind, dissolve, terminate or cancel this Agreement, or to request such annulment, rescission, dissolution, termination or cancellation after Closing, including on the basis of general provisions of contract law (including section 1184 of the Belgian Civil Code). This Clause 25.2 shall not exclude any liability for (or remedy in respect of) fraud nor prevent a party to seek enforcement in kind of any of its rights and/or indemnification in case of breach of an obligation by another Party.
25.3
The Purchaser shall not direct (and shall cause the Group Companies not to direct) any claim to any of the Resigning Directors or the Resigning Officers of the Group Companies referred to in Clause 5.2.3. The Purchaser shall exercise its rights as a direct or indirect shareholder of the Group Companies in a way that avoids any personal liability of the Resigning Directors and the Resigning Officers referred to in Clause 5.2.3. In particular, to the extent legally permissible, the Purchaser agrees to vote against the enforcement of claims of any Group Company against the Resigning Directors or Resigning Officers referred to in Clause 5.2.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing is without prejudice to the Purchaser’s right to direct a claim against the Sellers in their capacity as Sellers under this Agreement (on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement).
25.4
If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court or arbitral tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The Parties undertake to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision by a provision which achieves the original purpose and intention of the Parties to the fullest possible extent.
25.5
The nullity or non-applicability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or applicability of other provisions of the Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
25.6
No Party shall be deemed to have waived any rights or remedies arising out of this Agreement or out of any default or breach hereunder unless such Party executes the waiver in writing. If a Party waives a right or remedy arising out of this Agreement or out of any default or breach hereunder, such waiver shall not be construed to constitute a waiver of any other rights or remedies.



25.7
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements among the Parties with respect to its subject matter and constitutes a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement among the Parties with respect to its subject matter, except for the confidentiality agreement dated 3 July 2017 among Asco Industries NV and Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. (the “Confidentiality Agreement”), as amended by (i) an agreement entered into by and among the Company, Asco Industries NV and Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. on 14 November 2017 (the “First Addendum”), (ii) an agreement entered into by and among the Company, Asco Industries NV and Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. on 12 March 2018 (the “Second Addendum”), (iii) an agreement entered into by and among the Company, Asco Industries NV and Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. on 26 February 2018 (the “Third Addendum”), and (iii) an agreement entered into by and among the Company, Asco Industries NV and Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. on 26 April 2018 (the “Fourth Addendum”) and which will remain in full force up until Closing.

GOVERNING LAW AND COMPETENT COURTS
26.1
This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Belgium, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws, to the extent such principles or rules would permit or require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.
26.2
Any disputes in connection with or arising out of this Agreement that are not settled amicably shall be conclusively settled by way of arbitration under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) (the “Rules”) by three arbitrators, whereby each Party shall appoint one (1) arbitrator in accordance with said Rules as in force at the time of the request for arbitration and the two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall jointly appoint a third arbitrator, who shall act as chairman, in accordance with said Rules. If the Party-appointed arbitrators do not agree on the identity of the third arbitrator he shall be appointed in accordance with said Rules. The place of the arbitration shall be London. The arbitral proceedings and all documents delivered to or by the arbitrators shall be conducted in English. The arbitrators’ decision shall be final and binding on the Parties. The arbitrators must decide on which share of the costs each Party shall bear, which shares may not be equal as a consequence of the respective responsibility of each Party in the origin of the dispute or its continuation. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing is without prejudice to the right of a Party to seek injunctive relief in summary proceedings before any competent court and to submit a dispute in relation to the Price Adjustment to an Independent Auditor in accordance with Clauses 3.3.4 and 3.4.
