(C)    [Reserved]
2.2    Certain Transfers
2.2.1    Sales to Lessee. Unless a Lease Event of default has occurred and is continuing, the Lessor may sell a Lease Vehicle during such Lease Vehicle’s Vehicle Term to the relevant Lessee for an amount equal to the net book value under GAAP of such Lease Vehicle and in any event, subject to compliance with arm’s length principles.
2.2.2    Intra-Lease Transfers. From time to time, a particular Lessee (the “Transferor Lessee”) may desire to cease leasing a Lease Vehicle hereunder and another Lessee (the “Transferee Lessee”) may desire to commence leasing such Lease Vehicle hereunder. Upon delivery by such Lessee to the Lessor of written notice identifying by VIN each Lease Vehicle to be so transferred from such Transferor Lessee to such Transferee Lessee (such notice, an “Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedule”), each Lease Vehicle identified in such Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedule shall cease to be leased by the Transferor Lessee and shall contemporaneously commence being leased to the Transferee Lessee, provided that such transfer does not result in the breach of any prescribed limits relating to Lease Vehicles set out in the Related Documents. The Lessee agrees that upon such a transfer of any Lease Vehicle from one Lessee to another Lessee pursuant to this Agreement, such Transferor Lessee relinquishes all rights that it has in such Lease Vehicle pursuant to this Agreement. Each Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedule may be delivered electronically and may be delivered directly by either the applicable Transferor Lessee or the applicable Transferee Lessee or on behalf of either such party by any agent or designee of such party.
2.3    Transfer of Risks
As of the relevant Vehicle Lease Commencement Date, and until the later of:
(a)    the Vehicle Lease Expiration Date; or
(b)    such time at which the Lessee and the relevant sub-lessee (if any) no longer possesses such Lease Vehicle and the risk of loss, damage, theft, taking, destruction, attachment, seizure, confiscation or requisition with respect to such Lease Vehicle has been transferred to any third party,
the Lessee assumes and bears the risk of loss, damage, theft, taking, destruction, attachment, seizure, confiscation or requisition with respect to such Lease Vehicle, however caused or occasioned, and all other risks and liabilities relating to the Lease Vehicle.
2.4    Return
2.4.1    Lessee Right to Return.

1.    Incident notification. Vendor shall, immediately and in any event within 4 hours of becoming aware, promptly notify Hertz in writing of any actual or suspected accidental, unlawful or unauthorised destruction, loss, alteration, access to, disclosure of, or processing of Personal Data ("Incident"), and such notice shall include reasonable details of the Incident including without limitation: (i) a description of the Incident; (ii) likely consequences of the Incident; (iii) the number of data subjects affected, number of records affected and the types of records affected; and (iv) the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the Incident, including measures to mitigate possible adverse effects of the Incident.

(d)    Transfers outside the EU
No Personal Data processed by Vendor pursuant to this Agreement shall be exported, processed or otherwise accessed outside the European Economic Area and/or the UK without the prior written permission of Hertz.

Vendor agrees to accept any modifications to such standard clauses which are necessary to comply with laws applicable to such data transfer. Such binding agreement shall be without prejudice to the rights of Hertz under the Agreement including this Addendum.
(e)    Sub-contractors
In no event may Vendor subcontract the processing of any Personal Data which Vendor processes on Hertz's behalf, without the prior written consent of Hertz. Where that consent is given it will be conditional upon Vendor having executed a written contract with the third party which contains terms for the protection of Personal Data which are no less protective than the terms set out in this Addendum. Vendor shall remain responsible and liable for any acts or omissions of its subcontractors.

Schedule 1
Vendor shall implement administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Personal Data, protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Personal Data, and protect against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of Personal Data. In particular, Vendor shall have in place the following safeguards without limitation where appropriate or necessary to ensure the protection of Personal Data:
1.    Access Controls – policies, procedures and physical and technical controls: (i) to limit physical access to its information systems and the facility or facilities in which they are housed to properly authorised persons; (ii) to ensure that all members of its workforce who require access to Personal Data have appropriately controlled access, and to prevent those workforce members and others who should not have access from obtaining access; (iii) to authenticate and permit access only to authorized individuals and to prevent members of its workforce from providing Personal Data or information relating thereto to unauthorized individuals; and (iv) to encrypt and decrypt Personal Data where appropriate.
2.    Security Awareness and Training – a security awareness and training program for all members of Vendor's workforce (including management), which includes training on how to implement and comply with the safeguards in this Schedule 1.
3.    Security Breach Procedures – policies and procedures to detect, respond to and otherwise address security breaches, including procedures to monitor systems and to detect actual and attempted attacks on or intrusions into Personal Data or information systems relating thereto, and procedures to identify and respond to suspected or known security incidents, mitigate harmful effects of security incidents, and document security incidents and their outcomes.
4.    Contingency Planning – policies and procedures for responding to an emergency or other occurrence (for example, fire, vandalism, system failure and natural disaster) that damages Personal Data or systems that contain Personal Data, including a data backup plan and a disaster recovery plan.
5.    Device and Media Controls – policies and procedures that govern the receipt and removal of hardware and electronic media that contain Personal Data into and out of a Vendor facility, and the movement of these items within a Vendor facility, including policies and procedures to address the final disposition of Personal Data and/or the hardware or electronic media on which it is stored, and procedures for removal of Personal Data from electronic media before the media are made available for re-use.
