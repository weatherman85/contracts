Promptly upon obtaining knowledge that the full amount of any Property Protection Advance required to be made by the Back-Up Manager has not been so made, then the Indenture Trustee shall make the portion of such Property Protection Advance that was required to be, but was not, made by the Back-Up Manager, unless the Indenture Trustee determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that such Property Protection Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Property Protection Advance. In making any such determination, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely on any determination of nonrecoverability by the Property Manager or the Back-Up Manager, as the case may be. Any such Property Protection Advance made by the Back-Up Manager or the Indenture Trustee shall thereafter be reimbursable to the such Indenture Trustee or Back-Up Manager, together with Advance Interest thereon, in accordance Section 2.11 of the Indenture or from any Successor Property Manager. (e) If, prior to making any Property Protection Advance, the Property Manager shall have determined (which shall be evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Indenture Trustee), in accordance with the Servicing Standard, (i) that such Property Protection Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Property Protection Advance, and (ii) that the payment of such cost, expense or other amount for which a Property Protection Advance might be made is nonetheless in the best interest of the Noteholders, the Property Manager shall, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, withdraw (or, in the event the Property Manager is Spirit Realty, direct the Indenture Trustee to withdraw) funds from the Collection Account and use such funds in order to pay such costs, expenses and other amounts (collectively, “Emergency Property Expenses ”) to the extent necessary to preserve the security interest in, and value of, any Mortgaged Property or Mortgage Loan, as applicable. Any such funds withdrawn from the Collection Account to pay Emergency Property Expenses shall not constitute part of the Available Amount on any Payment Date. (f) In determining whether it has made a Nonrecoverable Property Protection Advance or whether any proposed Property Protection Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Property Protection Advance, the Property Manager (or, if applicable, the Back- Up Manager or Indenture Trustee) shall be entitled to (a) consider (among other things) the obligations of the Obligor under the terms of the related Lease Documents or Loan Documents as they may have been modified, (b) consider the related Mortgaged Properties or REO Properties in their “as is” or then current conditions and occupancies, as modified by such party’s assumptions (consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Property Manager or the Back-Up Manager) regarding the possibility and effects of future adverse changes with respect to such Mortgaged Properties or REO Properties, (c) estimate and consider (consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Property Manager or the Back-Up Manager) (among other things) future expenses, and (d) estimate and consider (consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Property Manager or the Back-Up Manager) (among other things) the timing of recoveries. If applicable to a Series of Notes, none of the Property Manager, the Back-Up Manager or the Indenture Trustee, as applicable, shall take into account amounts on deposit in the Post-Closing Acquisition Reserve Account in determining whether it has made a 50 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7

Nonrecoverable Property Protection Advance or whether any proposed Property Protection Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Property Protection Advance. In addition, any such Person may update or change its recoverability determinations at any time (but not reverse any other Person’s determination that a Property Protection Advance is a Nonrecoverable Property Protection Advance) and, consistent with the Servicing Standard, in the case of the Property Manager, the Back-Up Manager or the Indenture Trustee, may obtain promptly upon request, from the Special Servicer, any reasonably required analysis, appraisals or market value estimates or other information in the Special Servicer’s possession for making a recoverability determination. The determination by the Property Manager, the Back-Up Manager or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, that it has made a Nonrecoverable Property Protection Advance or that any proposed Property Protection Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Property Protection Advance, or any updated or changed recoverability determination, shall be evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered by such Back-Up Manager, Property Manager or Indenture Trustee to each other such Person and to the Issuers. Any such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the applicable Issuer, the Property Manager, the Noteholders the Back-Up Manager and the Indenture Trustee. The Officer’s Certificate shall set forth such determination of nonrecoverability and the considerations of the Property Manager, the Back-Up Manager or the Indenture Trustee, as applicable, forming the basis of such determination (which shall be accompanied by, to the extent available, information such as related income and expense statements, rent rolls, occupancy status and property inspections, and shall include an appraisal of the related Lease, Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property or REO Property). The Special Servicer shall promptly furnish any party required to make Property Protection Advances hereunder with any information in its possession regarding the Specially Serviced Assets which are Leases, Mortgaged Properties, Mortgage Loans and REO Properties as such party required to make Property Protection Advances may reasonably request for purposes of making recoverability determinations. In the case of a cross collateralized Mortgage Loan, such recoverability determination shall take into account the cross collateralization of the related cross-collateralized Mortgage Loan. (g) In the event that a P&I Shortfall exists with respect to any Series for any Payment Date, the Property Manager shall deposit an amount equal to such P&I Shortfall with respect to such Series into a Series Account for such Series no later than 11:00 a.m. New York time on the related Remittance Date, and such amount shall be added to (and applied as) Series Available Amount for such Series for such Payment Date (any such amount, a “ P&I Advance ”). (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Property Manager, the Back-Up Manager or the Indenture Trustee shall be required to make any P&I Advance that it determines would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance. In making a determination that any P&I Advance is (or is not) a Nonrecoverable Advance, the Property Manager, the Back-Up Manager or the Indenture Trustee, as applicable, may consider only the obligations of the Issuers under the terms of the transaction documents as they may have been modified, the Collateral in “as is” or then current condition and the timing and availability of anticipated cash flows as modified by such party’s assumptions regarding the possibility and effect of future adverse changes, together with such other factors, including but not limited to an estimate of future expenses, timing of recovery, the inherent risk of a protracted period to complete liquidation or the potential inability to liquidate Collateral as a result of intervening creditor claims or of a 51 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7

bankruptcy proceeding affecting the Issuer and the effect thereof on the existence, validity and priority of any security interest encumbering the Collateral, available cash on deposit in the Collection Account, the future allocations and disbursements of cash on deposit in the Collection Account, and the net proceeds derived from any of the foregoing. If applicable to a Series of Notes, none of the Property Manager, the Back-Up Manager or the Indenture Trustee, as applicable, shall take into account amounts on deposit in the Post-Closing Acquisition Reserve Account in such determination of whether a P&I Advance is (or is not) a Nonrecoverable Advance. Any such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the applicable Issuer, the Property Manager, the Special Servicer, the Noteholders the Back-Up Manager and the Indenture Trustee. (i) If the Indenture Trustee does not receive confirmation that the full amount of such P&I Advance has been made by 5:00 p.m. New York time on such Remittance Date for any Series, then the Back-Up Manager, after receipt of written notice from the Indenture Trustee, shall deposit, into a Series Account for such Series, the portion of such P&I Advance that was required to be, but was not, made by the Property Manager in respect of such Series by 10:00 a.m. New York time on the Payment Date, unless the Back-Up Manager determines (in accordance with clause (h) above) that such P&I Advance would be a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance. If the Indenture Trustee does not receive confirmation that the full amount of such P&I Advance for such Series that was required to be made in respect of such Series by such Back-Up Manager has been made by 11:00 a.m. New York time on such Remittance Date, then the Indenture Trustee, shall deposit, into a Series Account for such Series, the portion of such P&I Advance that was required to be, but was not, made by the Property Manager in respect of such Series on or prior to the time the Series Available Amount is distributed to such Series in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, unless the Indenture Trustee determines (in accordance with clause (h) above) that such P&I Advance would be a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance. In making any such determination, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely on any determination of nonrecoverability by the Property Manager or the Back-Up Manager, as the case may be. (j) Additionally, in the event that a Series of Notes is proposed to be issued after the Applicable Series Closing Date, the Property Manager will give notice to the Back-Up Manager and the Indenture Trustee of such proposed issuance. Within ten business days of receipt of such notice, the Back-Up Manager will be obligated to notify the Property Manager and the Indenture Trustee in writing as to whether the Back-Up Manager is willing to make Advances after such Series of Notes is issued. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that the Back-Up Manager delivers to the Property Manager and the Indenture Trustee a notice stating that it is unwilling to make such Advances after such issuance (with respect to any such Series of Notes, a “ Decline to Advance Notice ”), the Property Manager in its sole discretion (and without the consent of the Indenture Trustee, any Issuer or any Noteholder) will be permitted to remove the Back-Up Manager (a “ Discretionary Back-Up Manager Removal ”) and appoint a successor Back-Up Manager (so long as the Rating Condition is satisfied in connection with such appointment); provided , that, no such removal will be effective until such a successor Back-Up Manager is appointed. In the event of any such removal, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Back-Up Manager shall be required to (i) cooperate reasonably to effectuate the transfer of the back-up servicing rights, duties and obligations to such successor and (ii) take any actions 52 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide66
reasonably requested by the Property Manager in order to effectuate such appointment. In the event that a Series of Notes is issued with respect to which the Back-Up Manager has delivered to the Property Manager and the Indenture Trustee a Decline to Advance Notice but a successor Back-Up Manager has not been appointed, the Back-Up Manager will have no further obligation to make any Advance from and after the date (the “ Non-Advance Date ”) of issuance of such Series of Notes (but, for the avoidance of doubt, will have the right to be reimbursed for any Advances previously made). If the Back-Up Manager has delivered a Decline to Advance Notice to the Property Manager and the Indenture Trustee and a successor Back-Up Manager has not been appointed, the obligations of the Indenture Trustee to make Advances shall automatically cease as of the Non-Advance Date (but, for the avoidance of doubt, the Indenture Trustee will have the right to be reimbursed for any Advances previously made). So long as the Back-Up Manager has not been removed, after any Non-Advance Date, the Back-Up Manager may deliver an Officer’s Certificate to each of the Property Manager and the Indenture Trustee stating that it wishes to reinstate its obligation to make Advances. Upon such delivery, (x) the Back-Up Manager and the Indenture Trustee will again be obligated to make Advances to the extent required in accordance with this Agreement and in the manner described in this Agreement (as if the applicable Decline to Advance Notice had not been delivered) and (y) the Property Manager will no longer be permitted to effectuate a Discretionary Back-Up Manager Removal, in each case until a subsequent Decline to Advance Notice is delivered by the Back-Up Manager (which may only be delivered in connection with an additional proposed issuance of a Series of Notes). Section 3.04 Collection Account; Release Account; Exchange Reserve Account . (a) The Property Manager shall establish and maintain one or more separate accounts in the name of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders, for the collection of payments on and other amounts received in respect of the Leases, the Mortgaged Properties and the Mortgage Loans (collectively, the “ Collection Account ”), which shall be established in such manner and with the type of depository institution (the “ Collection Account Bank ”) specified in this Agreement that permits the Collection Account to be an Eligible Account. The Collection Account shall be an Eligible Account. If the Property Manager is Spirit Realty, the Property Manager shall establish and maintain the Collection Account at a Collection Account Bank at the Indenture Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall have the sole right of withdrawal from such account; provided , that the Property Manager shall be permitted to make withdrawals from such Collection Account to the extent expressly permitted under the terms hereof. If the Property Manager is not Spirit Realty or another Affiliate of the Issuers, the Collection Account shall be subject to an Account Control Agreement among the applicable Issuers, the Property Manager, the Indenture Trustee and the Collection Account Bank. Unless otherwise expressly required hereunder, the Property Manager shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the Collection Account, (i) other than payments and collections deposited into a Lockbox Account, within two (2) Business Days after receipt, the following payments and collections received or made by or on behalf of the Property Manager on or after the later of the applicable Transfer Date (other than payments due before the applicable Transfer Date) and (ii) in the case of collections and payments deposited into a Lockbox Account, in accordance with the Lockbox Transfer Requirements, the Property Manager shall instruct each Lockbox Account Bank to transfer the following payments and collections deposited in the 53 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7

Except as expressly permitted hereunder, the Property Manager shall not make any withdrawals from the Collection Account except in accordance with this Section 3.04 and Section 3.05(a) hereof. The Collection Account shall be maintained as a segregated account, separate and apart from trust funds created for certificates, bonds or notes of other series of notes (other than any Series) serviced by and the other accounts of the Property Manager.

slide68
after receipt (or, if later, the date on which such amounts are available to the Special Servicer), remit such amounts to the Property Manager for deposit into the Collection Account in accordance with this Section 3.04(a) , unless the Special Servicer determines, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that a particular item should not be deposited therein because of a restrictive endorsement or other reasonably appropriate reason.

With respect to any such amounts paid by check to the order of the Special Servicer, the Special Servicer shall endorse such check to the order of the Property Manager and shall deliver promptly, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day after receipt, any such check to the Property Manager by overnight courier, unless the Special Servicer determines, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that a particular item cannot be so endorsed and delivered because of a restrictive endorsement or other reasonably appropriate reason. The funds held in the Collection Account may be held as cash or invested in Permitted Investments in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.06(a) . Any interest or other income earned on funds in the Collection Account will be added to the Available Amount. (b) The Property Manager shall establish and maintain at a bank designated by the Indenture Trustee a segregated account in the name of the Indenture Trustee for the deposit of cash proceeds from the sale of any Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property or receipt of any Balloon Payments or Principal Prepayments (the “ Release Account ”).

slide70
into the Release Account excluding amounts on deposit in the Exchange Account, but including equivalent amounts on deposit in the Exchange Reserve Account) shall be deposited as Unscheduled Proceeds into the Collection Account and will be included in the Available Amount on the Payment Date relating to the Collection Period in which such deposit occurs. If the Like- Kind Exchange Program is established, in connection with the sale or disposition of a Mortgaged Property, the Property Manager may elect to deposit or cause to be deposited the related Net Release Price into an Exchange Account (in lieu of the Release Account) for the purpose of consummating an Exchange pursuant to Section 7.01(d). Section 3.06 Investment of Funds in the Collection Account and the Release Account . (a) The Property Manager may direct any institution maintaining the Collection Account to invest the funds held therein in one or more Permitted Investments bearing interest or sold at a discount, and maturing, unless payable on demand, not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Remittance Date relating to the Payment Date for which such funds will constitute Available Amounts, which may be in the form of a standing direction. (b) The Property Manager may direct any institution maintaining the Release Account or Exchange Reserve Account to invest the funds held therein in one or more specific Permitted Investments bearing interest or sold at a discount, and maturing, unless payable on demand, not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the day such amounts are required to be distributed pursuant to Section 3.05(b) , which may be in the form of a standing direction.

Any investment of funds in the Collection Account, the Release Account, the Expense Reserve Account and the Servicing Accounts shall be made in the name of the Indenture Trustee (in its capacity as such). The Property Manager shall promptly deliver to the Indenture Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee shall maintain continuous possession of, any Permitted Investment that is either (i) a “certificated security,” as such term is defined in the Uniform Commercial Code, or (ii) other property in which the lack of possession of such property could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the Noteholders’ interest in such property. If amounts on deposit in the Collection Account, the Release Account, the Expense Reserve Account or the Servicing Accounts are at any time invested in a Permitted Investment payable on demand, the Property Manager shall: (i) consistent with any notice required to be given thereunder, demand that payment thereon be made on the last day such Permitted Investment may otherwise 57 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide71
mature thereunder in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) all amounts then payable thereunder and (2) the amount required to be withdrawn on such date; and (ii) demand payment of all amounts due thereunder promptly upon determination by the Property Manager that such Permitted Investment would not constitute a Permitted Investment in respect of funds thereafter on deposit in the Collection Account, the Release Account, the Expense Reserve Account or the Servicing Accounts, as applicable. (f) Interest and investment income realized on funds deposited in the Collection Account and, if applicable, the Release Account and the Exchange Reserve Account that constitute part of the Available Amount for any Collection Period, to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, shall be added to the Available Amount for such Collection Period and distributed in accordance with Section 2.11 of the Indenture on the applicable Payment Date. Notwithstanding the investment of funds held in the Collection Account, for purposes of the calculations hereunder, including the calculation of the Available Amount, the amounts so invested shall be deemed to remain on deposit in the Collection Account. Except as provided in Section 5.03(a) , the Property Manager shall have no liability for any investment of funds in the Collection Account, the Release Account, the Expense Reserve Account , the Exchange Reserve Account or Servicing Account. (g) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if any default occurs in the making of a payment due under any Permitted Investment, or if a default occurs in any other performance required under any Permitted Investment, the Property Manager may take such action as may be appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including the institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings. Section 3.07 Maintenance of Insurance Policies; Errors and Omissions and Fidelity Coverage . (a) The Property Manager (other than with respect to Specially Serviced Assets) and the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Assets) shall use reasonable efforts in accordance with the Servicing Standard to cause the related Obligor to maintain for each Mortgaged Property all insurance coverage as is required under the terms of the related Lease or Mortgage Loan, as applicable (including for the avoidance of doubt, any Environmental Policy); provided , that if and to the extent that any such Lease or Mortgage Loan permits the lessor thereunder any discretion (by way of consent, approval or otherwise) as to the insurance coverage that the related Obligor is required to maintain, the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall exercise such discretion in a manner consistent with the Servicing Standard; and provided , further , that, if and to the extent that a Lease or Mortgage Loan so permits, the related Obligor shall be required to obtain the required insurance coverage from Qualified Insurers that have a claims-paying ability rated at least “A:VIII” by A.M. Best’s Key Rating Guide and at least “A” by S&P, which are licensed to do business in the state wherein the related Obligor or the Mortgaged Property subject to the policy, as applicable, is located. If such Obligor does not maintain the required insurance or, with respect to any Environmental Policy in place as of the applicable First Collateral Date, the Property Manager will itself cause such insurance to be maintained with Qualified Insurers meeting such criteria; provided , that the 58 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide72
Property Manager shall not be required to maintain such insurance if the Indenture Trustee (as mortgagee of record on behalf of the Noteholders) does not have an insurable interest or the Property Manager has determined (in its reasonable judgment in accordance with the Servicing Standard) that either (i) such insurance is not available at a commercially reasonable rate and the subject hazards are at the time not commonly insured against by prudent owners of properties similar to the Mortgaged Property located in or around the region in which such Mortgaged Property is located or (ii) such insurance is not available at any rate. Subject to Section 3.17(b) , the Special Servicer shall also use reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained for each REO Property no less insurance coverage than was previously required of the Obligor under the related Mortgage or Lease and at a minimum, (i) hazard insurance with a replacement cost rider and (ii) comprehensive general liability insurance, in each case, in an amount customary for the type and geographic location of such REO Property and consistent with the Servicing Standard; provided , that all such insurance shall be obtained from Qualified Insurers that, if they are providing casualty insurance, shall have a claims-paying ability rated at least “A:VIII” by A.M. Best’s Key Rating Guide and “A” by S&P. The cost of any such insurance coverage obtained by either the Property Manager or the Special Servicer shall be a Property Protection Advance to be paid by the Property Manager. All such insurance policies shall contain (if they insure against loss to property) a “standard” mortgagee clause, with loss payable to the Property Manager, as agent of and for the account of the applicable Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, and shall be issued by an insurer authorized under applicable law to issue such insurance. Any amounts collected by the Property Manager or the Special Servicer under any such policies (other than amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property or amounts to be released to the related Tenant, in each case in accordance with the Servicing Standard) shall be deposited in the Collection Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 2.11 of the Indenture. (b) The Property Manager or Special Servicer may satisfy its obligations under Section 3.07(a) by obtaining, maintaining or causing to be maintained a blanket or forced place insurance policy. If applicable, the Property Manager or the Special Servicer shall obtain and maintain, or cause to be obtained and maintained on behalf of each applicable Issuer, a master forced place insurance policy or a blanket policy (or an endorsement to an existing policy) insuring against hazard losses (not otherwise insured by a Tenant or Borrower due to a default by such Tenant or Borrower under the insurance covenants of its Lease or Mortgage Loan or because a Tenant or Borrower permitted to self-insure fails to pay for casualty losses) on the applicable Mortgaged Properties that it is required to service and administer, which policy shall (i) be obtained from a Qualified Insurer having a claims-paying ability rated at least “A:VIII” by A.M. Best’s Key Rating Guide and at least “A” by S&P, and (ii) provide protection equivalent to the individual policies otherwise required under Section 3.07(a) . The Property Manager and the Special Servicer shall bear the cost of any premium payable in respect of any such blanket policy (other than blanket policies specifically obtained for Mortgaged Properties or REO Properties) without right of reimbursement; provided , that if the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, causes any Mortgaged Property or REO Property to be covered by such blanket policy in order to satisfy such obligations, the incremental costs of such insurance applicable to such Mortgaged Property or REO Property shall constitute, and be reimbursable as, a Property Protection Advance (it being understood that such incremental costs incurred by the Special Servicer shall be paid by the Property Manager to the Special Servicer and that such payment shall constitute, and be reimbursable as, a Property Protection Advance). If the Property 59 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide73
Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable, causes any Mortgaged Property or REO Property to be covered by a force-placed insurance policy, the incremental costs of such insurance applicable to such Mortgaged Property or REO Property (which shall not include any minimum or standby premium payable for such policy whether or not any Mortgaged Property or REO Property is covered thereby) shall be paid as a Property Protection Advance (it being understood that such incremental costs incurred by the Special Servicer shall be paid by the Property Manager to the Special Servicer and that such payment shall constitute, and be reimbursable as, a Property Protection Advance). Any such policy may contain a deductible clause (not in excess of a customary amount) in which case the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as appropriate, shall, if there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property a hazard insurance policy complying with the requirements of Section 3.07(a) and there shall have been one or more losses that would have been covered by such policy, promptly deposit into the Collection Account from its own funds the amount not otherwise payable under the blanket policy in connection with such loss or losses because of such deductible clause.

(g) The Special Servicer shall have the right to determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the advisability of seeking to obtain a deficiency judgment if the state in which the Collateral securing a Specially Serviced Loan is located and the terms of the Mortgage Loan permit such an action and shall, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, seek such deficiency judgment if it deems advisable.

Any amounts advanced by Spirit Realty, in its capacity as Property Manager, in respect of environmental matters that are payable by the applicable Issuer under an Environmental Indemnity Agreement and are not reimbursed on a current basis as described above, shall be deemed to be payment by Spirit Realty, in its capacity as Support Provider, and Spirit Realty shall not be entitled to reimbursement of any such amounts as a Property Protection Advance. Section 5.04 Term of Service; Property Manager and Special Servicer Not to Resign . Subject to (and without limiting) Section 5.02 , Section 6.04(a) and Section 6.04(b) , hereof, neither the Property Manager nor the Special Servicer shall resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it, except upon determination that the performance of its duties hereunder is no longer permissible under applicable law or are in material conflict by reason of applicable law with any other activities carried on by it, such other activities causing such a conflict being of a type and nature carried on by the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, at the date of this Agreement. Any such determination permitting the resignation of the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect that shall be delivered to the Issuers and the Indenture Trustee. No such resignation shall become effective until a successor shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the resigning party hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of the Property Manager and the Special Servicer may cause all or part of the obligations and duties imposed on it by this Agreement to be assumed by, and may assign part or all of its rights, benefits or privileges hereunder to, another Person; provided , that (i) the assuming party is an Eligible Successor and (ii) unless the assuming party or assignee is an Affiliate of the Property Manager or Special Servicer whose obligations and duties hereunder are guaranteed by the Support Provider, the Rating Condition shall have been satisfied with respect to any such assumption or assignment. Upon any such assignment or assumption, the Property Manager and/or the Special Servicer, as 81 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide95
applicable, shall be relieved from all liability hereunder for acts or omissions the assuming Person or assignee, as applicable, occurring after the date of such assignment or assumption. If the Property Manager, Special Servicer or Back-Up Manager shall resign pursuant to this Section 5.04 or be removed pursuant to Section 6.01 , then such resigning Property Manager, Special Servicer or Back-Up Manager, as applicable, must pay all reasonable costs and expenses associated with the transfer of its duties and cooperate reasonably with its successor in order to effect such transfer. Except as provided herein, neither the Property Manager nor the Special Servicer shall assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or privileges hereunder to any other Person or delegate to or subcontract with, or authorize or appoint, any other Person to perform any of the duties, covenants or obligations to be performed by it hereunder, or cause any other Person to assume such duties, covenants or obligations.

The Issuers may, but are not obligated to, enforce the obligations of the Property Manager and the Special Servicer hereunder and may, but are not obligated to, perform, or cause a designee to perform, any defaulted obligation of the Property Manager or the Special Servicer hereunder, or, in connection with any such defaulted obligation, exercise the related rights of the Property Manager or the Special Servicer hereunder; provided , however , that neither the Property Manager nor the Special Servicer shall be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder by virtue of such performance by any such Issuer or its designee. The Issuer shall not have any responsibility or liability for any action or failure to act by or with respect to the Property Manager or the Special Servicer. Section 5.06 [Reserved] . Section 5.07 Property Manager or Special Servicer as Owner of Notes . The Property Manager or an Affiliate of the Property Manager, or the Special Servicer or an Affiliate of the Special Servicer, may become the holder of any Notes or any LLC Interests with the same rights (unless otherwise expressly provided in a Transaction Document) as it would have if it were not the Property Manager, the Special Servicer or any such Affiliate. If, at any time during which the Property Manager, the Special Servicer or any of their respective 82 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7

Affiliates is the holder of any Note or LLC Interest, the Property Manager or the Special Servicer proposes to take or omit to take action (i) which action or omission is not expressly prohibited by the terms hereof and would not, in the Property Manager or the Special Servicer’s good faith judgment, violate the Servicing Standard, and (ii) which action, if taken, or omission, if made, might nonetheless, in the Property Manager’s or the Special Servicer’s good faith judgment, be considered by other Persons to violate the Servicing Standard, the Property Manager or the Special Servicer may, but need not, seek the approval of the holders of the Notes and the LLC Interests to such action or omission by delivering to the Issuers and the Indenture Trustee a written notice that (a) states that it is delivered pursuant to this Section 5.07 , (b) identifies the portion of Notes and LLC Interests beneficially owned by the Property Manager or the Special Servicer or any Affiliate of the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, and (c) describes in reasonable detail the action that the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, proposes to take or omit. Upon receipt of such notice, the Issuers shall forward such notice to the applicable holders of the LLC Interests. If, at any time, the Requisite Global Majority separately consent in writing to the proposal described in the such notice, and if the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, takes action and/or omits to take action as proposed in such notice, such action and/or omission will be deemed to comply with the Servicing Standard. It is not the intent of the foregoing provision that the Property Manager or the Special Servicer be permitted to invoke the procedure set forth herein with respect to routine servicing matters arising hereunder, but rather in the case of unusual circumstances. ARTICLE VI SERVICER REPLACEMENT EVENTS Section 6.01 Servicer Replacement Events (a) “ Servicer Replacement Event ” wherever used herein with respect to the Property Manager or Special Servicer, means any one of the following events: (i) any failure by the Property Manager or the Special Servicer to remit or deposit moneys, as required under the Indenture or this Agreement, to the Collection Account, the Release Account or the Payment Account, which failure remains unremedied for two (2) Business Day after the earlier of (x) the date on which notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, is given to the Property Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable, by the Indenture Trustee, or to such Property Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable, and the Indenture Trustee by the Noteholders holding at least 25% of the Aggregate Series Principal Balance and (y) actual knowledge of such failure by such Property Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable; or (ii) the Property Manager fails to make any P&I Advance as required by this Agreement; (iii) the Property Manager fails to make any Property Protection Advance or fails to pay (or, in the event the Property Manager is Spirit Realty, fails to direct the Indenture Trustee to pay) any Emergency Property Expenses from funds on deposit in the Collection Account, in each case as required by the Indenture or this Agreement, which 83 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide97
failure remains unremedied for four (4) Business Days after the earlier of (x) the date on which notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to such Property Manager by the Indenture Trustee, or to such Property Manager and the Indenture Trustee by the Noteholders holding at least 25% of the Aggregate Series Principal Balance and (y) actual knowledge of such failure by such Property Manager; or (iv) either the Property Manager or the Special Servicer fails to comply in any material respect with any other of the covenants or agreements on the part of the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, contained in this Agreement, which failure continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which written notice of such failure shall have been received by the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable; provided , however , that if the failure is capable of being cured and such Property Manager or Special Servicer is diligently pursuing that cure, the 30 day period will be extended for another 30 days; or (v) any breach on the part of the Property Manager or the Special Servicer of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that materially and adversely affects the interests of the Issuers or the Noteholders, and that continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which notice of such breach is given to the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable; provided , however , that if the breach is capable of being cured and such Property Manager or Special Servicer is diligently pursuing that cure, the 30 day period will be extended for another 30 days; or (vi) (a) the Property Manager or the Special Servicer consents to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official relating to it or relating to all or substantially all of its assets or admits in writing its inability to pay its debts or takes other actions indicating its insolvency or inability to pay its obligations; or (b) a decree or order of a court having jurisdiction in any involuntary case for the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings is entered against the Property Manager or the Special Servicer and the decree or order remains in force for a period of 60 days; provided , that if any decree or order cannot be discharged, dismissed or stayed within the 60-day period, such Property Manager or Special Servicer will have an addition 30 days to effect the discharge, so long as it commenced proceedings to have the decree or order dismissed within the initial 60-day period and it is continuing to pursue the discharge; or (vii) either the Property Manager or Special Servicer assigns any of its obligations to any third party other than as permitted under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document and does not remedy such breach within five Business Days of such assignment; or (viii) either the Property Manager or the Special Servicer fails to observe any material reporting requirements under this Agreement, which failure remains unremedied 30 days after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be 84 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide98
remedied, shall have been given to the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable, by any other party to this Agreement or the Indenture Trustee; or (ix) any Issuer or the Indenture Trustee has received notice in writing from any Rating Agency then rating any Notes at the request of an Issuer citing servicing concerns and stating that the continuation of the Property Manager or the Special Servicer in such capacity would, in and of itself, result in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of any of the ratings then assigned by such Rating Agency or other nationally recognized statistical ratings organization to such Notes; or (x) the declaration of an Indenture Event of Default; or (xi) an Early Amortization Event occurs and is continuing that is reasonably determined by the Back-Up Manager (unless the Back-Up Manager is then serving as Property Manager or Special Servicer) or the Requisite Global Majority to be primarily attributable to acts or omissions of the Property Manager or the Special Servicer rather than general market factors (provided that the occurrence of an Early Amortization Event determined to be attributable to the acts or omissions of a Property Manager or Special Servicer that has been replaced shall not cause a Servicer Replacement Event with respect to any Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer (including the Back-Up Manager)); or (xii) the Property Manager or the Special Servicer has engaged in fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its performance under this Agreement and such event could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the use, value or operation of the Collateral Pool (taken as a whole), and remains unremedied for 30 days after the Property Manager or the Special Servicer receives written notice thereof. When a single entity acts as Property Manager and Special Servicer, a Servicer Replacement Event in one such capacity shall constitute a Servicer Replacement Event in each such capacity. In the event that the same entity is serving as both Property Manager and Special Servicer and such entity is terminated hereunder in one such capacity (in accordance with Section 6.01(b)) , it shall automatically be terminated in both such capacities. Each of the Property Manager and the Special Servicer will notify the Indenture Trustee in writing of the occurrence of a Servicer Replacement Event or an event that, with the giving of notice or the expiration of any cure period, or both, would constitute a Servicer Replacement Event promptly upon obtaining actual knowledge thereof. (b) (i) If any Servicer Replacement Event (other than any Servicer Replacement Event under Sections 6.01(a)(vi) ) occurs with respect to the Property Manager or the Special Servicer (in either case, for purposes of this Section 6.01(b) , the “ Defaulting Party ”) of which a responsible officer of the Indenture Trustee shall have actual knowledge shall occur, then the Indenture Trustee shall provide written notice thereof to the Noteholders requesting that the Noteholders (excluding Spirit Realty and its affiliates) direct the removal of the Property Manager and/or Special Servicer or waive such Servicer Replacement Event. In the event that, while such Servicer Replacement Event is continuing, the Requisite Global Majority directs the 85 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide99
removal of such Property Manager and/or Special Servicer, as applicable, the Indenture Trustee will terminate such Property Manager or Special Servicer by notice in writing to the Defaulting Party (with a copy of such notice to each other party hereto). For the avoidance of doubt, no such direction may occur in the event that a Servicer Replacement Event is not continuing. Upon the occurrence of any Servicer Replacement Event under Sections 6.01(a)(vi) with respect to any Defaulting Party, such Defaulting Party shall be immediately terminated without any further action on the part of any other person. Following any such termination of a Defaulting Party as described in this Section 6.01(b) , the Back-Up Manager shall replace the Defaulting Party as Property Manager and/or Special Servicer, as applicable, subject to and in accordance with Section 6.02(b) and shall have all the rights, duties and obligations of the Property Manager and/or Special Servicer, as applicable, hereunder until a Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer, as applicable, shall have been appointed. Promptly after any such termination, the Indenture Trustee (acting at the written direction of the Requisite Global Majority) shall appoint a successor property manager (any property manager appointed in such manner, the “ Successor Property Manager ”) and/or a successor special servicer (any special servicer appointed in such manner, the “ Successor Special Servicer ”) in accordance with Section 6.01(b)(iii) , each of which shall serve as and have all the rights, duties and obligations of the Property Manager and/or of the Special Servicer, as applicable, hereunder; provided , that any Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer must be an Eligible Successor at the time of such appointment. Upon its appointment, the Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer shall be the successor in all respects to the Property Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable, and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed upon the Property Manager or Special Servicer by the terms and provisions hereof; provided , that, no such Successor Special Servicer or Successor Property Manager shall have any liability with respect to any duties or obligations of the terminated Property Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable, accruing prior to the date of such appointment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Servicer Replacement Event under Section 6.01(b)(ii) or (iii) occurs as a result of a failure by the Property Manager to make any Advance and the Back-Up Manager makes such Advance, for so long as the Property Manager has not reimbursed the amount of such Advance to the Back-Up Manager, the Back-Up Manager will have the right to immediately terminate the Property Manager (and the Special Servicer, if the Property Manager and the Special Servicer are the same entity) and become the Successor Property Manager (and the Successor Special Servicer, if the Property Manager being replaced and the Special Servicer are the same entity). In any such event, the Back-Up Manager shall be deemed to have been appointed the Successor Property Manager and, if applicable, the Successor Special Servicer hereunder (regardless of whether any of the other conditions of this Section 6.01(b) are satisfied). (ii) Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, any such appointment of a Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer, other than the Back-Up Manager, will be subject to (i) the satisfaction of the Rating Condition and (ii) the written agreement of the Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, together with an Opinion of Counsel regarding the enforceability of such agreement. Subject to the foregoing conditions set forth in Section 6.01(b) , any person, including any holder of Notes or LLC Interests or 86 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide100
any Affiliate thereof, may be appointed as Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer. (iii) In the event that a Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer (other than the Back-Up Manager), as applicable, has failed to assume all of the duties and obligations of the Defaulting Party as provided in this Agreement within 30 days of written notice of termination to such Defaulting Party (the “ Successor Replacement Date ”), the Back-Up Manager shall automatically (and without further action and regardless of whether any of the other conditions of this Section 6.01(b) are satisfied) be (and shall have been deemed to have been appointed) the Successor Property Manager or the Successor Special Servicer, as applicable, under this Agreement; provided , however , that the Indenture Trustee shall (at the direction of the Requisite Global Majority) replace the Back-Up Manager acting as Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer without cause upon 30 days written notice and appoint a new Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer specified in such Requisite Global Majority’s direction; provided , that (i) such appointment shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the appointment of a Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer, as applicable, set forth in this Section 6.01(b)(i) and (if) the Back-Up Manager shall continue serving as Property Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable, until such appointment is effected. (iv) In the event that a Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer, as applicable, other than the Back-Up Servicer has not been appointed within thirty (30) days of the applicable Successor Replacement Date, the Back-Up Manager may (but shall not be obligated to) direct the Indenture Trustee to appoint (for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the terms and conditions of the appointment of a Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer, as applicable, set forth in Sections 6.01(b)(i) and (ii)) a Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer designated by the Back-Up Manager (which successor will be subject to the criteria described above, including satisfaction of the Rating Condition); provided , that the Back- Up Manager will continue serving as Property Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable, until a Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer, as applicable, has been so appointed. If the Back-Up Manager does not direct the Indenture Trustee to appoint a Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer within 30 days of the applicable Successor Replacement Date, then such Back-Up Manager will continue to serve as Property Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable, and will no longer be permitted to so direct the Indenture Trustee. (v) Each of the Property Manager and the Special Servicer agrees that, if it is terminated pursuant to this Section 6.01(b) , it shall (i) promptly (and in any event not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination) provide the Back-Up Manager or any Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer, as applicable, with all documents and records in accordance with Section 6.02(b) , (ii) cooperate with such successor in effecting the termination of the duties, obligations, responsibilities and rights of the Property Manager or Special Servicer hereunder and transferring such duties, obligations and responsibilities to such successor, (including 87 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide101
carrying out the actions set forth in Section 6.02) and (iii) in the event that it receives any amounts that constitute Collateral, transfer such amounts to the Property Manager (it being understood that if the Property Manager has been terminated, such amounts shall be transferred to the Successor Property Manager that succeeds such Property Manager) within two (2) Business Days after receipt thereof; provided , however , that the Property Manager and the Special Servicer each shall, if terminated pursuant to this Section 6.01(b) , continue to be obligated for or entitled to pay or receive all amounts accrued or owing by or to it under this Agreement on or prior to the date of such termination, whether in respect of Property Protection Advances or otherwise, and it and its directors, officers, employees and agents shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.03(a) notwithstanding any such termination. Any Successor Property Manager or a Successor Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to diligently complete the physical transfer of servicing from the terminated Property Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable, with the cooperation of such Property Manager or Special Servicer. Section 6.02 Successor Property Manager . (a) In the event that a Successor Property Manager (including the Back-Up Manager) is appointed, the terminated Property Manager shall arrange for the delivery to the Successor Property Manager of all of the Servicing Files (other than with respect to any Specially Serviced Asset), which Servicing Files shall contain sufficient data to permit the Successor Property Manager to assume the duties of the Property Manager hereunder without delay on account of the absence of relevant servicing information. In the event that a Successor Special Servicer (including the Back-Up Manager) is appointed, the terminated Special Servicer shall arrange for the delivery to the Successor Special Servicer of all of the Servicing Files for any Specially Serviced Asset, which Servicing Files shall contain sufficient data to permit the Successor Special Servicer to assume the duties of the Special Servicer hereunder without delay on account of the absence of relevant servicing information. If the Back-Up Manager has made any Advances that the Property Manager was required to make but did not make which have not been reimbursed, any Successor Property Manager (other than the Back-Up Manager) will be required to reimburse the Back-Up Manager for such Advances as a condition to its appointment as successor (and any amount so reimbursed will be deemed to constitute Advances made by the Successor Property Manager). (b) The Issuers, if they determine in their reasonable discretion that enforcement rights and/or remedies are available to the holders of the Notes against the terminated Property Manager or Special Servicer and it is prudent under the circumstances to enforce such rights, agree to enforce their rights under this Agreement against the terminated Property Manager or Special Servicer, including any rights they have to enforce each Defaulting Party’s obligation to fully cooperate in the orderly transfer and transition of servicing and otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that the Successor Special Servicer or Successor Property Manager discovers or becomes aware of any errors in any records or data of the terminated Special Servicer or Property Manager which impairs its ability to perform its duties hereunder, such Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer shall notify the Issuers and the Indenture Trustee in writing of such errors and shall, at such terminated Special Servicer’s or 88 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7

The Back- Up Manager will perform an initial comprehensive data integrity review and a monthly review of this information to determine whether it provides adequate information to enable the Back-Up Manager to perform its obligations hereunder as the Back-Up Manager. To the extent that the Back-Up Manager determines within ten (10) calendar days of its receipt of such information that such information is adequate for the Back-Up Manager to perform its obligations as the Back-Up Manager, the Back-Up Manager will provide the Issuers and the Indenture Trustee with written notice to that effect. To the extent that the Back-Up Manager determines within ten (10) calendar days of its receipt of such information that such information is inadequate for the Back-Up Manager to perform its obligations as the Back-Up Manager, the Back-Up Manager will provide prompt written notice to the Issuers and the Property Manager identifying any deficiencies in such information that do not enable the Back-Up Manager to perform its obligations as the Back-Up Manager. The Property Manager shall use its best efforts to provide any such deficient information to the Back-Up Manager within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of such notice from the Back-Up Manager. (d) Within ten (10) Business Days of the date of receipt from the Property Manager, the Back-Up Manager shall, in order to understand the purpose of each data field (and the interrelationships among such data fields), review the form of Determination Date Report, Modified Collateral Detail and Realized Loss Report and the Special Servicer Report, each in the form agreed to by the Property Manager and the Back-Up Manager. Provided the data in the Determination Date Report, the Special Servicer Report and the Modified Collateral Detail and Realized Loss Report are in a format readable by the Back-Up Manager, the Back-Up Manager shall create a set of conversion routines and database mapping programs, as necessary, that will enable the Back-Up Manager to (i) receive such data from the Property Manager on a monthly basis and to ensure that the data is readable, and (ii) independently generate such Determination Date Reports and Special Servicer Reports, as applicable, in the event that it is appointed Successor Property Manager or Successor Special Servicer. (e) On a monthly basis, the Back-Up Manager shall (x) verify receipt of the Determination Date Report and the Special Servicer Report required to be delivered by the Property Manager, together with any other records and data supplied to the Issuers, Indenture Trustee or otherwise hereunder, by Property Manager with respect to the Mortgage Loans and Leases, and (y) verify that such records and data are in a readable format. 89 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7

Section 6.03 Additional Remedies of the Issuers and the Indenture Trustee upon a Servicer Replacement Event . During the continuance of any Servicer Replacement Event, so long as such Servicer Replacement Event shall not have been remedied, in addition to the rights specified in Section 6.01 , the Issuers shall have the right, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the right, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, to take all actions now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute to enforce its rights and remedies and to protect the interests, and enforce the rights and remedies, of the Noteholders (including the institution and prosecution of all judicial, administrative and other proceedings and the filings of proofs of claim and debt in connection therewith).

Notwithstanding anything in the Transaction Documents to the contrary, no Release Price will be payable with respect to any Release Parcel transferred to a Tenant pursuant to an obligation under the related Lease in connection with a Specified Permitted Subdivision and, in such case, the Indenture Trustee will release such property from the Collateral Pool, subject only to receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Property Manager certifying that: (i) the Specified Permitted Subdivision will not result in a reduction of the Collateral Value of the original property that was subdivided in connection with such Specified Permitted Subdivision, (ii) the Specified Permitted Subdivision is in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of law, (iii) the Specified Permitted Subdivision will not impair or otherwise adversely affect the liens, security interests and other rights of the Issuers in the portion of the property not being released (the “Remaining Parcel ”), (iv) the Remaining Parcel will comply with all requirements of law (including, without limitation, all zoning (including any parking requirements) and building 92 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7

In determining the Fair Market Value with respect to any Mortgaged Property or Mortgage Loan, the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall establish a price determined to be the most probable price which such Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. In making any such determination, the Property Manager or Special Servicer, as applicable, (X) may obtain an MAI appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property; provided that in the case of a sale of a Mortgaged Property or Mortgage Loan to an affiliate of any Issuer or Spirit Realty pursuant to clause (vi) of the definition of “Release Price”, the Property Manager or Special Servicer shall obtain such an appraisal unless (x) an appraisal with respect to the related Mortgaged Property or property securing such Mortgage Loan has been delivered within twelve months prior to the sale of such Mortgaged Property or Mortgage Loan and (y) neither the Property Manager nor the Special Servicer reasonably believes that the value of such Mortgaged Property or property securing such Mortgage Loan has materially increased in value since the date of such appraisal and (Y) shall assume the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: (i) buyer and seller are typically motivated; (ii) both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests; (iii) a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; (iv) payment is made in terms of cash in United States dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and (v) the price represents the normal consideration for such Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale. In making any such determination, the Property Manager or Special Servicer shall take into account, among other factors, the period and amount of the delinquency on such Mortgage Loan or Lease, the occupancy level and physical condition of the related Mortgaged Property, the state of the local economy in the area where the Mortgaged Property is located, and the time and expense associated with a purchaser’s foreclosing on the related Mortgaged Property. In addition, the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall refer to all other relevant information obtained by it or otherwise 93 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide107
contained in the related servicing file, taking into account any change in circumstances regarding the related Mortgaged Property known to the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable, that would materially affect the value of the related Mortgaged Property reflected in the most recent related appraisal. Furthermore, the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable, may consider available objective third party information obtained from generally available sources, as well as information obtained from vendors providing real estate services to the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable, concerning the market for distressed real estate loans and the real estate market for the subject property type in the area where the related Mortgaged Property is located. The Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable, may also conclusively rely on any opinions or reports of qualified independent experts in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Property Manager or the Special Servicer, as applicable, pursuant to making a determination of Fair Market Value shall constitute, and be reimbursable as, Property Protection Advances.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, an Issuer may obtain the release of a Mortgage Loan or a Mortgaged Property in exchange for one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans or one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgaged Properties, as applicable, subject to the terms hereof. (e) (i) After giving effect to any sale or exchange of a Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property, the aggregate Collateral Value of all Released Mortgaged Properties and Released Mortgage Loans (determined as of the release date with respect to each such Released Mortgage Loan) sold or exchanged by any Issuer during the Closing Date Period in which such sale or exchange occurs shall not exceed 35.0% of the Aggregate Collateral Value (determined as of the applicable Starting Closing Date) unless the Rating Condition is satisfied; provided that releases and exchanges or substitutions in connection with Collateral Defects, sales pursuant to the exercise of Third Party Purchase Options, sales during the Disposition Period, transfers or exchanges of Terminated Lease Properties, Risk-Based Substitutions and releases in connection with an Early Refinancing Prepayment shall not be subject to the foregoing limitation or taken into consideration in determining such aggregate Collateral Values of such Released Mortgaged Properties and Released Mortgage Loans. (ii) If any of the following criteria are satisfied, the release of a Mortgaged Property in exchange for one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgaged Properties or, solely in the case of clause (d) below, the release of a Mortgage Loan in exchange for one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans or Qualified Substitute Mortgaged Properties will constitute a “ Risk-Based Substitution ”: (a) the remaining term to maturity of the related Lease is less than three years from the date of the proposed 94 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7

substitution and the Property Manager, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, determines that there is a reasonable risk of non-renewal of such Lease ; based on written communications from the Tenant under such Lease, the Property Manager, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, determines that there is a reasonable risk of nonrenewal of such Lease; (c) the Issuer has received from the Tenant under the related Lease written notice of the non-renewal of such Lease; or (d) the Property Manager, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, determines that there is a reasonable risk of monetary default by the Tenant under such Lease or the Borrower under such Mortgage Loan, as applicable, or such a default has occurred or such Lease or Mortgage Loan is or relates to a Defaulted Asset. (iii) If the Class Principal Balance of any Class of Notes is greater than zero on the Payment Date that is three years prior to the earliest Legal Final Payment Date of any outstanding Class of Notes, then a disposition period (the “ Disposition Period ”) will commence on such Payment Date and will continue until the earlier of (i) the date on which the Class Principal Balance of the Class of Notes having the earliest Legal Final Payment Date is reduced to zero and (ii) such Legal Final Payment Date. During the Disposition Period, the Property Manager will be required to utilize efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to either (i) sell (on behalf of the Issuers) each Mortgage Loan and Mortgaged Property for a price equal to the greater of (x) the applicable Release Price and (y) the applicable Allocated Loan Amount (and in each case in accordance with the other provisions set forth in this Agreement) or (ii) sell (on behalf of the Issuers) Mortgage Loans and Mortgaged Properties for no less than an amount sufficient to generate proceeds which would, when combined with all other amounts available for such purposes on deposit in the Collection Account and applied as described in Section 2.11 of the Indenture, cause the Class Principal Balance of each Class of Notes to be reduced to zero and all outstanding expenses of the Issuers to be paid. In the event of any such disposition, the sales proceeds therefor will be deposited as Unscheduled Proceeds into the Collection Account and applied as part of the Available Amount on the Payment Date relating to the Collection Period in which such deposit occurs. (f) If the Rating Condition is satisfied, the Property Manager and the Issuers may enter into an Exchange Agreement with a Qualified Intermediary to establish a Like-Kind Exchange Program. If a Like-Kind Exchange Program is established, the Property Manager and the Issuers (or the Property Manager on behalf of the Issuers) shall be permitted to: (i) Assign their respective rights to each Relinquished Property Agreement and Replacement Property Agreement to the Qualified Intermediary in accordance with Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iv) of the Treasury Regulations (or any successor section thereto); and (ii) Deposit all Relinquished any Net Release Price constituting a portion ofRelinquished Property Proceeds with respect to any Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property in the Exchange Account (in lieu of depositing such amount in the Release Account), which such amounts may be disbursed from such Exchange Account to the applicable seller of any Replacement Property; 95 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
 
slide109
Provided , that, no such assignment pursuant to clause (d)(i) above or deposit in the Exchange Account pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be permitted unless, (A) the Issuers have established the Exchange Reserve Account and (B) the Exchange Cash Collateral relating to the applicable Relinquished Property has been deposited in the Exchange Reserve Account. If an Early Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing, all Exchange Cash Collateral on deposit in the Exchange Reserve Account shall be transferred to the Collection Account as Unscheduled Proceeds and applied as Unscheduled Principal Payments on the Payment Date following the commencement of such Early Amortization Event. Upon such transfer of Exchange Cash Collateral, the Indenture Trustee will release any interest in any right to receive any related amounts of Relinquished Property Proceeds on deposit in the Exchange Account. Upon the purchase of any Qualified Substitute Mortgaged Property using any Relinquished Property Proceeds, if directed by the Property Manager, the Indenture Trustee will release Exchange Cash Collateral in an amount equal to the amount of such Relinquished Property Proceeds that were used for such purchase directly to the Issuers without depositing such amount in the Collection Account. In addition, if any Relinquished Property Proceeds on deposit in the Exchange Account are transferred to the Release Account as a result of a failed exchanged or otherwise, if directed by the Property Manager, the Indenture Trustee to release Exchange Cash Collateral in an amount equal to the amount of such Relinquished Property Proceeds transferred to the Release Account directly to the Issuers without depositing such amount in the Collection Account. Exchange Cash Collateral will be invested in Permitted Investments as directed by the Issuers, or if no such direction is received, will be held uninvested. Any such Permitted Investment must (i) have a maturity date prior to the Payment Date following the date of such direction and (ii) have a short-term rating of not less than “A- 2” by S&P. Any interest or other income earned on funds in the Exchange Reserve Account (including interest on any Permitted Investments) will be treated as Unscheduled Proceeds part of the Available Amount for the applicable Payment Date.

(a) In the event any third party authorized to do so exercises a Third Party Purchase Option in accordance with the terms of the applicable Lease, the Third Party Option Price (without giving effect to clause (ii) in the definition thereof) paid by such third party shall be deposited into the Release Account (or, during the continuance of an Early Amortization Amount, the Collection Account), at the direction of the Property Manager, and upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Property Manager to the effect that such deposit has been or will be made (which the Property Manager shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee and the Issuers promptly after such deposit is made or immediately prior to the time at which such deposit will be made), the Indenture Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be provided to it by the Property Manager and are reasonably necessary to release the related Mortgage or any other lien on or security interest in such Mortgaged Property (each, a “ Third Party Option Mortgaged Property ”), whereupon such Mortgaged Property may be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by such Issuer, free 96 US-DOCS\ 96557504.7 102826315.7
