CUSTODIAN AGREEMENT

This Agreement, dated as of October 5, 2020, is between BLACKSTONE PRIVATE CREDIT FUND, a statutory trust organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the “Fund”), and STATE STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, a Massachusetts trust company (the “Custodian”).

WITNESSETH: that in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

SECTION 1. EMPLOYMENT OF CUSTODIAN AND PROPERTY TO BE HELD BY IT.

The Fund hereby employs the Custodian as the custodian of its assets, including securities (including stocks, shares, bonds, debentures, notes, mortgages or other obligations and any certificates, receipts, warrants or other instruments representing rights to receive, purchase, or subscribe for the same, or evidencing or representing any other rights or interests therein, or in any property or assets) which the Fund desires to be held in places within the United States (“domestic securities”) and securities it desires to be held outside the United States (“foreign securities”). The Fund agrees to deliver to the Custodian all securities and cash owned by it (other than any securities or cash of the Fund held by a futures commission merchant or commodity clearing organization pursuant to Rule 17f-6 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)), and all payments of income, payments of principal or capital distributions received by it with respect to all securities owned by it from time to time, and the cash consideration received by it for such new shares of beneficial interest of the Fund (“Shares”) as may be issued or sold from time to time. The Custodian shall not be responsible for any property of the Fund held or received by the Fund but not delivered to the Custodian. With respect to uncertificated shares (the “Underlying Shares”) of registered “investment companies” (as defined in Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time (the “1940 Act”)), whether in the same “group of investment companies” (as defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the 1940 Act) or otherwise, including pursuant to Section 12(d)(1)(F) of the 1940 Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Underlying Portfolios”) the holding of confirmation statements that identify the shares as being recorded in the Custodian’s name on behalf of the Fund will be deemed custody for purposes hereof.

Upon receipt of “Proper Instructions” (as such term is defined in Section 7 hereof), the Custodian shall from time to time employ one or more sub-custodians located in the United States, but only in accordance with an applicable vote by the Board of Trustees of the Fund (the “Board”). The Custodian may employ as sub-custodian for the Fund’s foreign securities the foreign banking institutions and foreign securities depositories designated in Schedules A and B hereto, but only in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 3 and 4. The Custodian shall have no more or less responsibility or liability to the Fund on account of any actions or omissions of any sub-custodian so employed than any such sub-custodian has to the Custodian.

SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE CUSTODIAN WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTY OF THE FUND HELD BY THE CUSTODIAN IN THE UNITED STATES.

SECTION 2.1 HOLDING SECURITIES. The Custodian shall hold and physically segregate for the account of the Fund all non-cash property, to be held by it in the United States, including all domestic securities owned by the Fund other than (a) securities which are maintained pursuant to Section 2.8 in a clearing agency which acts as a securities depository or in a book-entry system authorized by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (each, a “U.S. Securities System”) and (b) Underlying Shares owned by the Fund which are maintained pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof in an account with State Street Bank and Trust Company or such other entity which may from time to time act as a transfer agent for the Underlying Portfolios and with respect to which the Custodian is provided with Proper Instructions (each, an “Underlying Transfer Agent”).

SECTION 2.2 DELIVERY OF SECURITIES. The Custodian shall release and deliver domestic securities owned by the Fund held by the Custodian, in a U.S. Securities System account of the Custodian, or in an account at the Underlying Transfer Agent, only upon receipt of Proper Instructions, which may be continuing instructions when deemed appropriate by the parties, and only in the following cases:

13

The Custodian shall provide to the Board the information with respect to custody and settlement practices as described on Schedule C hereto in countries in which the Custodian employs a Foreign Sub-Custodian at the time or times set forth on such Schedule. The Custodian may revise Schedule C from time to time, provided that no such revision shall result in the Board being provided with substantively less information than had been previously provided hereunder.

SECTION 4.5. REGISTRATION OF FOREIGN SECURITIES. The foreign securities maintained in the custody of a Foreign Sub-Custodian (other than bearer securities) shall be registered in the name of the Fund or in the name of the Custodian or in the name of any Foreign Sub-Custodian or in the name of any nominee of the foregoing, and the Fund agrees to hold any such nominee harmless from any liability that results solely from such nominee’s status as a holder of record of such foreign securities. The Custodian or a Foreign Sub-Custodian shall not be obligated to accept securities on behalf of the Fund under the terms of this Agreement unless the form of such securities and the manner in which they are delivered are in accordance with reasonable market practice.

SECTION 4.6 BANK ACCOUNTS. The Custodian shall identify on its books as belonging to the Fund cash (including cash denominated in foreign currencies) deposited with the Custodian. Where the Custodian is unable to maintain, or market practice does not facilitate the maintenance of, cash on the books of the Custodian, a bank account or bank accounts shall be opened and maintained outside the United States on behalf of the Fund with a Foreign Sub-Custodian. All accounts referred to in this Section shall be subject only to draft or order by the Custodian (or, if applicable, such Foreign Sub-Custodian) acting pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to hold cash received by or from or for the account of the Fund. Cash maintained on the books of the Custodian (including its branches, subsidiaries and affiliates), regardless of currency denomination, is maintained in bank accounts established under, and subject to the laws of, The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

SECTION 4.7. COLLECTION OF INCOME. The Custodian shall use reasonable commercial efforts to collect all income and other payments with respect to the Foreign Assets held hereunder to which the Fund shall be entitled and shall credit such income, as collected, to the Fund.

SECTION 4.8 SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS. With respect to the foreign securities held pursuant to this Section 4, the Custodian will use reasonable commercial efforts to facilitate the exercise of voting and other shareholder rights, subject always to the laws, regulations and practical constraints that may exist in the country where such securities are issued. The Fund acknowledges that local conditions, including lack of regulation, onerous procedural obligations, lack of notice and other factors may have the effect of severely limiting the ability of the Fund to exercise shareholder rights.

 

14

SECTION 4.9. COMMUNICATIONS RELATING TO FOREIGN SECURITIES. The Custodian shall transmit promptly to the Fund written information with respect to materials received by the Custodian via the Foreign Sub-Custodians from issuers of the foreign securities being held for the account of the Fund (including, without limitation, pendency of calls and maturities of foreign securities and expirations of rights in connection therewith). With respect to tender or exchange offers, the Custodian shall transmit promptly to the Fund written information with respect to materials so received by the Custodian from issuers of the foreign securities whose tender or exchange is sought or from the party (or its agents) making the tender or exchange offer. The Custodian shall not be liable for any untimely exercise of any tender, exchange or other right or power in connection with foreign securities or other property of the Fund at any time held by it unless (i) the Custodian or the respective Foreign Sub-Custodian is in actual possession of such foreign securities or property and (ii) the Custodian receives Proper Instructions with regard to the exercise of any such right or power, and both (i) and (ii) occur at least three business days prior to the date on which the Custodian is to take action to exercise such right or power. The Custodian shall also transmit promptly to the Fund all written information received by the Custodian via the Foreign Sub-Custodians from issuers of the foreign securities being held for the account of the Fund regarding any class action or other litigation in connection with foreign securities or other assets issued outside the United States and then held, or previously held, during the term of this Agreement by the Custodian for the account of the Fund, including, but not limited to, opt-out notices and proof-of-claim forms. For avoidance of doubt, upon and after the effective date of any termination of this Agreement, the Custodian shall have no responsibility to so transmit any information under this Section 4.9.

SECTION 4.10. LIABILITY OF FOREIGN SUB-CUSTODIANS. Each agreement pursuant to which the Custodian employs a Foreign Sub-Custodian shall, to the extent possible, require the Foreign Sub-Custodian to exercise reasonable care in the performance of its duties, and to indemnify, and hold harmless, the Custodian from and against any loss, damage, cost, expense, liability or claim arising out of or in connection with the Foreign Sub-Custodian’s performance of such obligations. At the Fund’s election, it shall be entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the Custodian with respect to any claims against a Foreign Sub-Custodian as a consequence of any such loss, damage, cost, expense, liability or claim if and to the extent that the Fund has not been made whole for any such loss, damage, cost, expense, liability or claim.

SECTION 4.11 TAX LAW. The Custodian shall have no responsibility or liability for any obligations now or hereafter imposed on the Fund or the Custodian as custodian of the Fund by the tax law of the United States or of any state or political subdivision thereof. It shall be the responsibility of the Fund to notify the Custodian of the obligations imposed on the Fund or the Custodian as custodian of the Fund by the tax law of countries other than those mentioned in the above sentence, including responsibility for withholding and other taxes, assessments or other governmental charges, certifications and governmental reporting. The sole responsibility of the Custodian with regard to such tax law shall be to use reasonable efforts to assist the Fund with respect to any claim for exemption or refund under the tax law of countries for which the Fund has provided such information.

SECTION 5. PAYMENTS FOR SALES OR REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF SHARES.

 

15

The Custodian shall receive from the distributor for the Shares or from the Transfer Agent and deposit into the Fund’s account such payments as are received for Shares thereof issued or sold from time to time by the Fund. The Custodian will provide timely notification to the Fund and the Transfer Agent of any receipt by it of payments for Shares of the Fund.

From such funds as may be available for the purpose, the Custodian shall, upon receipt of instructions from the Transfer Agent, make funds available for payment to holders of Shares who have delivered to the Transfer Agent a request for redemption or repurchase of their Shares. In connection with the redemption or repurchase of Shares, the Custodian is authorized upon receipt of instructions from the Transfer Agent to wire funds to or through a commercial bank designated by the redeeming shareholders. In connection with the redemption or repurchase of Shares, the Custodian shall honor checks drawn on the Custodian by a holder of Shares, which checks have been furnished by the Fund to the holder of Shares, when presented to the Custodian in accordance with such procedures and controls as are mutually agreed upon from time to time between such Fund and the Custodian.

SECTION 6. FOREIGN EXCHANGE.

6.1. GENERALLY. Upon receipt of Proper Instructions, which for purposes of this section may also include security trade advices, the Custodian shall facilitate the processing and settlement of foreign exchange transactions. Such foreign exchange transactions do not constitute part of the services provided by the Custodian under this Agreement.

6.2. FUND ELECTIONS. The Fund (or its Investment Advisor acting on its behalf) may elect to enter into and execute foreign exchange transactions with third parties that are not affiliated with the Custodian, with State Street Global Markets, which is the foreign exchange division of State Street Bank and Trust Company and its affiliated companies (“SSGM”), or with a sub-custodian. Where the Fund or its Investment Advisor gives Proper Instructions for the execution of a foreign exchange transaction using an indirect foreign exchange service described in the Client Publications (as defined below), the Fund (or its Investment Advisor) instructs the Custodian, on behalf of the Fund, to direct the execution of such foreign exchange transaction to SSGM or, when the relevant currency is not traded by SSGM, to the applicable sub-custodian. The Custodian shall not have any agency (except as contemplated in preceding sentence), trust or fiduciary obligation to the Fund, its Investment Advisor or any other person in connection with the execution of any foreign exchange transaction. The Custodian shall have no responsibility under this Agreement for the selection of the counterparty to, or the method of execution of, any foreign exchange transaction entered into by the Fund (or its Investment Advisor acting on its behalf) or the reasonableness of the execution rate on any such transaction. Client Publications means the general client publications of State Street Bank and Trust Company available from time to time available to clients and their investment managers.

6.3. FUND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The Fund acknowledges that in connection with all foreign exchange transactions entered into by the Fund (or its Investment Advisor acting on its behalf) with SSGM or any sub-custodian, SSGM and each such sub-custodian:

(i) shall be acting in a principal capacity and not as broker, agent or fiduciary to the Fund or its Investment Advisor;

 

16

(ii) shall seek to profit from such foreign exchange transactions, and are entitled to retain and not disclose any such profit to the Fund or its Investment Advisor; and

(iii) shall enter into such foreign exchange transactions pursuant to the terms and conditions, including pricing or pricing methodology, (a) agreed with the Fund or its Investment Advisor from time to time or (b) in the case of an indirect foreign exchange service, (i) as established by SSGM and set forth in the Client Publications with respect to the particular foreign exchange execution services selected by the Fund or the Investment Advisor or (ii) as established by the sub-custodian from time to time.

6.4. TRANSACTIONS BY STATE STREET. The Custodian or its affiliates, including SSGM, may trade based upon information that is not available to the Fund (or its Investment Advisor acting on its behalf), and may enter into transactions for its own account or the account of clients in the same or opposite direction to the transactions entered into with the Fund (or its Investment Manager), and shall have no obligation, under this Agreement, to share such information with or consider the interests of their respective counterparties, including, where applicable, the Fund or the Investment Advisor.

SECTION 7. PROPER INSTRUCTIONS.

Proper Instructions, which may also be standing instructions, as used throughout this Agreement, shall mean instructions received by the Custodian from the Fund a Fund’s duly authorized investment manager or investment adviser, or a person or entity duly authorized by either of them. Such instructions may be in writing signed by the Authorized Persons or may be in a tested communication or in a communication utilizing access codes effected between electro-mechanical or electronic devices or may be by such other means and utilizing such intermediary systems and utilities as may be agreed to from time to time by the Custodian and the person or persons giving such instructions, provided that the Fund has followed any security procedures agreed to from time to time by the Fund and the Custodian, including, but not limited to, the security procedures selected by the Fund in the Funds Transfer Addendum to this Agreement, the terms of which are hereby agreed to. Oral instructions will be considered Proper Instructions if the Custodian reasonably believes them to have been given by a person authorized to give such instructions with respect to the transaction involved. The Fund shall cause all oral instructions to be confirmed in writing and signed by two Authorized Persons. For purposes of this Section, Proper Instructions shall include instructions received by the Custodian pursuant to any multi-party agreement which requires a segregated asset account in accordance with Section 2.9 of this Agreement. The Fund shall cause its duly authorized officer to certify to the Custodian in writing the names and specimen signatures of persons authorized to give Proper Instructions (“Authorized Persons”) in the incumbency certificate attached hereto. The Custodian shall be entitled to rely upon the identity and authority of such persons until it receives notice from the Fund to the contrary.

SECTION 8. ACTIONS PERMITTED WITHOUT EXPRESS AUTHORITY.

The Custodian may in its discretion, without express authority from the Fund:

 

17

1) make payments to itself or others for minor expenses of handling securities or other similar items relating to its duties under this Agreement, provided that all such payments shall be accounted for and reported to the Fund;

2) surrender securities in temporary form for securities in definitive form;

3) endorse for collection, in the name of the Fund, checks, drafts and other negotiable instruments; and

4) in general, attend to all non-discretionary details in connection with the sale, exchange, substitution, purchase, transfer and other dealings with the securities and property of the Fund except as otherwise directed by the Board.

SECTION 9. EVIDENCE OF AUTHORITY.

The Custodian shall be protected in acting upon any instructions, notice, request, consent, certificate or other instrument or paper believed by it to be genuine and to have been properly executed by or on behalf of the Fund. The Custodian may receive and accept a copy of a resolution of the Board, certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Fund (“Certified Resolution”), as conclusive evidence (a) of the authority of any person to act in accordance with such resolution or (b) of any determination or of any action by the Board as described in such resolution, and such resolution may be considered as in full force and effect until receipt by the Custodian of written notice to the contrary.

SECTION 10. DUTIES OF CUSTODIAN WITH RESPECT TO THE BOOKS OF ACCOUNT AND UNDERLYING TRANSFER AGENTS.

The Custodian shall cooperate with and supply necessary information to the entity or entities appointed by the Board to keep the books of account of the Fund. The Fund acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to investments maintained with the Underlying Transfer Agent, the Underlying Transfer Agent is the sole source of information on the number of shares of the Fund held by it and that the Custodian has the right to rely on holdings information furnished by the Underlying Transfer Agent to the Custodian in performing its duties under this Agreement, including without limitation, the duties set forth in this Section 10 and in Section 11 hereof; provided, however, that the Custodian shall be obligated to reconcile information as to purchases and sales of Underlying Shares contained in trade instructions and confirmations received by the Custodian and to report promptly any discrepancies to the Underlying Transfer Agent.

SECTION 11. RECORDS.

The Custodian shall create and maintain all records relating to its activities and obligations under this Agreement in such manner as will meet the obligations of the Fund under the 1940 Act, including Section 31 thereof and Rules 31a-1 and 31a-2 thereunder. All such records shall be the property of the Fund and shall at all times during the regular business hours of the Custodian be open for inspection by duly authorized officers, employees or agents of the Fund and employees and agents of the SEC. The Custodian shall, at the Fund’s request, supply the Fund with a tabulation of securities owned by the Fund and held by the Custodian and shall, when requested to do so by the Fund and for such compensation as shall be agreed upon between the Fund and

 

18

the Custodian, include certificate numbers in such tabulations. The Custodian shall provide the Fund with access to its statements and records electronically in accordance with the Remote Access Services Addendum attached hereto.

SECTION 12. REPORTS TO FUND BY INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS.

The Custodian shall take all reasonable action, as the Fund may from time to time request, to obtain from year to year favorable opinions from the Fund’s independent public accountants with respect to its activities hereunder in connection with the preparation of the Fund’s Form 10 and Form 10-K or other annual reports to the SEC and with respect to any other requirements thereof.

The Custodian shall provide the Fund, at such times as the Fund may reasonably require, with reports by independent public accountants on the accounting system, internal accounting control and procedures for safeguarding securities, futures contracts and options on futures contracts, including securities deposited and/or maintained in a U.S. Securities System or a Foreign Securities System (either, a “Securities System”), relating to the services provided by the Custodian under this Agreement; such reports, shall be of sufficient scope and in sufficient detail, as may reasonably be required by the Fund to provide reasonable assurance that any material inadequacies would be disclosed by such examination, and, if there are no such inadequacies, the reports shall so state.

SECTION 13. COMPENSATION OF CUSTODIAN.

The Custodian shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for its services and expenses as Custodian, as agreed upon from time to time between the Fund and the Custodian.

SECTION 14. RESPONSIBILITY OF CUSTODIAN.

So long as and to the extent that it is in the exercise of reasonable care, the Custodian shall not be responsible for the title, validity or genuineness of any property or evidence of title thereto received by it or delivered by it pursuant to this Agreement and shall be held harmless in acting upon any notice, request, consent, certificate or other instrument reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to be signed by the proper party or parties, including any futures commission merchant acting pursuant to the terms of a three-party futures or options agreement. The Custodian shall be held to the exercise of reasonable care and good faith in carrying out the provisions of this Agreement, but shall be kept indemnified by and shall be without liability to the Fund for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith without negligence, fraud, bad faith, or willful misconduct, including, without limitation, acting in accordance with any Proper Instruction. It shall be entitled to rely on and may act upon advice of counsel (who may be counsel for the Fund) on all matters, and shall be without liability for any action reasonably taken or omitted pursuant to such advice. The Custodian shall be without liability to the Fund for any loss, liability, claim or expense resulting from or caused by anything that is part of Country Risk (as defined in Section 3 hereof), including without limitation nationalization, expropriation, currency restrictions, insolvency of a Foreign Sub-Custodian, acts of war, revolution, riots or terrorism. The Custodian shall be liable for the acts or omissions of a Foreign Sub-Custodian to the same extent as if such action or omission were performed by the Custodian itself, taking into account the facts and circumstances and the established local market practices and laws prevailing in the particular jurisdiction in which the Fund elects to invest.

 

19

Except as may arise from the Custodian’s own negligence, fraud, bad faith, or willful misconduct or the negligence, fraud, bad faith, or willful misconduct of a sub-custodian or agent, the Custodian shall be without liability to the Fund for any loss, liability, claim or expense resulting from or caused by; (i) events or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Custodian or any sub-custodian or Securities System or any agent or nominee of any of the foregoing, including, without limitation, the interruption, suspension or restriction of trading on or the closure of any securities market, power or other mechanical or technological failures or interruptions, computer viruses or communications disruptions, work stoppages, natural disasters, or other similar events or acts; (ii) errors by the Fund or its duly-authorized investment manager or investment advisor in their instructions to the Custodian provided such instructions have been in accordance with this Agreement; (iii) the insolvency of or acts or omissions by a Securities System; (iv) any delay or failure of any broker, agent or intermediary, central bank or other commercially prevalent payment or clearing system to deliver to the Custodian’s sub-custodian or agent securities purchased or in the remittance or payment made in connection with securities sold; (v) any delay or failure of any company, corporation, or other body in charge of registering or transferring securities in the name of the Custodian, the Fund, the Custodian’s sub-custodians, nominees or agents or any consequential losses arising out of such delay or failure to transfer such securities including non-receipt of bonus, dividends and rights and other accretions or benefits; (vi) delays or inability to perform its duties due to any disorder in market infrastructure with respect to any particular security or Securities System; and (vii) any provision of any present or future law or regulation or order of the United States of America, or any state thereof, or any other country, or political subdivision thereof or of any court of competent jurisdiction.

If the Fund requires the Custodian to take any action with respect to securities, which action involves the payment of money or which action may, in the opinion of the Custodian, result in the Custodian or its nominee assigned to the Fund being liable for the payment of money or incurring liability of some other form, the Fund, as a prerequisite to requiring the Custodian to take such action, shall provide indemnity to the Custodian in an amount and form satisfactory to it.

If the Custodian, its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents advances cash or securities for any purpose (including but not limited to securities settlements, foreign exchange contracts and assumed settlement), or in the event that the Custodian or its nominee shall incur or be assessed any taxes, charges, expenses, assessments, claims or liabilities in connection with the performance of this Agreement, except such as may arise from its or its nominee’s own negligent action, negligent failure to act or willful misconduct, or if the Fund fails to compensate the Custodian pursuant to Section 13 hereof, any property at any time held for the account of the Fund shall be security therefor and should the Fund fail to repay the Custodian promptly, the Custodian shall be entitled to utilize available cash and to dispose of the Fund’s assets to the extent necessary to obtain reimbursement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the Fund and the Custodian hereby agrees that in no event shall either the Fund or the Custodian be liable to the other party

 

20

for indirect, special or consequential damages, or for any damages of a similar nature, provided, however, that the foregoing shall in no way limit the Custodian’s recovery relating to third party claims asserted against it and related fees and expenses for which indemnification is available hereunder.

SECTION 15. EFFECTIVE PERIOD, TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT.

This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for an initial term ending                     , 2023 (the “Initial Term”). After the expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms (each, a “Renewal Term”) unless a written notice of non-renewal is delivered by the non-renewing party no later than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, as the case may be. During the Initial Term and thereafter, either party may terminate this Agreement: (i) in the event of the other party’s material breach of a material provision of this Agreement that the other party has either (a) failed to cure or (b) failed to establish a remedial plan to cure that is reasonably acceptable, within 60 days’ written notice of such breach, or (ii) in the event of the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the other party or upon the happening of a like event to the other party at the direction of an appropriate agency or court of competent jurisdiction. Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph the Fund shall pay Custodian its compensation due through the effective termination date and shall reimburse Custodian for its costs, expenses and disbursements.

In the event of: (i) the Fund’s termination of this Agreement for any reason other than as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph or (ii) a transaction not in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which the Custodian is not retained to continue providing services hereunder to the Fund (or its respective successor), the Fund shall reimburse the Custodian for its costs, expenses and disbursements and reasonable counsel fees and, if either (i) or (ii) occur during the Initial Term, pay the Custodian its compensation due through the end of the Initial Term (based upon the average monthly compensation previously earned by Custodian). Upon receipt of such payment and reimbursement, the Custodian will deliver the Fund’s securities and cash as set forth herein below. For the avoidance of doubt, no payment will be required pursuant to clause (ii) of this paragraph in the event of any transaction such as (a) the liquidation or dissolution of the Fund and distribution of the Fund’s assets as a result of the Board’s determination in its reasonable business judgment that the Fund is no longer viable (b) a merger of the Fund into, or the consolidation of the Fund with, another entity, or (c) the sale by the Fund of all, or substantially all, of its assets to another entity, in each of (b) and (c) where the Custodian is retained to continue providing services to the Fund (or its respective successor) on substantially the same terms as this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund shall have the right to terminate this agreement upon written notice to the Custodian provided it reimburses the Custodian in the manner set forth above.

The provisions of Sections 4.11, 13, 14, 24 and 25 of this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement for any reason.

This Agreement may be amended at any time in writing by mutual agreement of the parties hereto.

SECTION 16. SUCCESSOR CUSTODIAN.

 

21

If a successor custodian for the Fund shall be appointed by the Board, the Custodian shall, upon termination, deliver to such successor custodian at the office of the Custodian, duly endorsed and in the form for transfer, all securities of the Fund then held by it hereunder and shall transfer to an account of the successor custodian all of the securities of the Fund held in a Securities System or at the Underlying Transfer Agent.

Upon termination, if no such successor custodian shall be appointed, the Custodian shall, in like manner, upon receipt of Proper Instructions, deliver at the office of the Custodian and transfer such securities, funds and other properties in accordance with such resolution. Unless so directed by the Proper Instructions, in no event shall the Custodian deliver the securities, funds and other properties to the Fund.

In the event that no Proper Instructions designating a successor custodian or alternative arrangement shall have been delivered to the Custodian on or before the date when such termination shall become effective, then the Custodian shall have the right to deliver to a bank or trust company, which is a “bank” as defined in the 1940 Act, doing business in Boston, Massachusetts, or New York, New York, of its own selection, with such bank or trust company being among the top ten institutions in terms of assets under custody in the United States according to reasonably acceptable industry rankings, all securities, funds and other properties held by the Custodian hereunder and all instruments held by the Custodian relative thereto and all other property held by it under this Agreement on behalf of the Fund, and to transfer to an account of such successor custodian all of the Fund’s securities held in any Securities System or at the Underlying Transfer Agent. Thereafter, such bank or trust company shall be the successor of the Custodian under this Agreement.

In the event that securities, funds and other properties remain in the possession of the Custodian after the date of termination hereof owing to failure of the Fund to provide Proper Instructions to appoint a successor custodian, the Custodian shall be entitled to fair compensation for its services during such period as the Custodian retains possession of such securities, funds and other properties and the provisions of this Agreement relating to the duties and obligations of the Custodian shall remain in full force and effect.

SECTION 17. INTERPRETIVE AND ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS.

In connection with the operation of this Agreement, the Custodian and the Fund may from time to time agree on such provisions interpretive of or in addition to the provisions of this Agreement as may in their joint opinion be consistent with the general tenor of this Agreement. Any such interpretive or additional provisions shall be in a writing signed by both parties and shall be annexed hereto, provided that no such interpretive or additional provisions shall contravene any applicable federal or state regulations or any provision of the Fund’s governing documents. No interpretive or additional provisions made as provided in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be an amendment of this Agreement.

Upon written request from the Fund’s investment adviser, the Custodian shall promptly return or destroy any nonpublic portfolio holdings information relating to the Fund, except the Custodian may keep copies of the information for the purpose of maintaining appropriate business records or as may be required by law or any regulatory authority.

this Agreement or any other agreement between the Fund and the Custodian or one of its Affiliates, including Data regarding transactions and portfolio holdings relating to the Fund, and publish, sell, distribute or otherwise commercialize the Data; provided that, unless the Fund otherwise consents, Data is combined or aggregated with information relating to (i) other customers of the Custodian and/or its Affiliates or (ii) information derived from other sources, in each case such that any published information will be displayed in a manner designed to prevent attribution to or identification of such Data with the Fund. The Fund agrees that Custodian and/or its Affiliates may seek to profit and realize economic benefit from the commercialization and use of the Data, that such benefit will constitute part of the Custodian’s compensation for services under this Agreement or such other agreement, and the Custodian and/or its Affiliates shall be entitled to retain and not be required to disclose the amount of such economic benefit and profit to the Fund.

(c) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, nothing in this Section 25 shall limit the confidentiality and data-protection obligations of the Custodian and its Affiliates under this Agreement and applicable law. The Custodian shall cause any Affiliate, agent or service provider to which it has disclosed Data pursuant to this Section 25 to comply at all times with confidentiality and data-protection obligations as if it were a party to this Agreement.

This Agreement and all schedules, addenda, exhibits, attachments and amendments hereto may be reproduced by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, miniature photographic or other similar process. The parties hereto all/each agree that any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding, whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by a party in the regular course of business, and that any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence.

SECTION 27. REMOTE ACCESS SERVICES ADDENDUM.

The Custodian and the Fund agree to be bound by the terms of the Remote Access Services Addendum attached hereto as Exhibit A.

In accordance with Regulation GG, the Fund is hereby notified that “restricted transactions,” as such term is defined in Section 233.2(y) of Regulation GG, are prohibited in any dealings with the Custodian pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise between or among any party hereto.

and regulations, that contains appropriate security measures to safeguard the personal information of the Fund’s shareholders, employees, trustees and/or officers that the Custodian receives, stores, maintains, processes or otherwise accesses in connection with the provision of services hereunder.

SECTION 31. SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS ELECTION.

SEC Rule 14b-2 requires banks which hold securities for the account of customers to respond to requests by issuers of securities for the names, addresses and holdings of beneficial owners of securities of that issuer held by the bank unless the beneficial owner has expressly objected to disclosure of this information. In order to comply with the rule, the Custodian needs the Fund to indicate whether it authorizes the Custodian to provide the Fund’s name, address, and share position to requesting companies whose securities the Fund owns. If the Fund tells the Custodian “no”, the Custodian will not provide this information to requesting companies. If the Fund tells the Custodian “yes” or does not check either “yes” or “no” below, the Custodian is required by the rule to treat the Fund as consenting to disclosure of this information for all securities owned by the Fund or any funds or accounts established by the Fund. For the Fund’s protection, the Rule prohibits the requesting company from using the Fund’s name and address for any purpose other than corporate communications. Please indicate below whether the Fund consents or objects by checking one of the alternatives below.

YES          The Custodian is authorized to release the Fund’s name, address, and share positions.

NO    x      The Custodian is not authorized to release the Fund’s name, address, and share positions.
