The specimen signature for each such Authorized Representative of the Company initially authorized hereunder is set forth on Exhibit A.

Section 7. Transmission of Collateral Files. Prior to any shipment of any Collateral Files or Collateral Documents hereunder pursuant to the request of the Company (on behalf of itself or any Subsidiary), the Company shall deliver to the Document Custodian written instructions as to the method of shipment and shipper(s) the Document Custodian is to utilize in connection with the transmission of Collateral Files or Collateral Documents in the performance of the Document Custodian’s duties hereunder (which instruction shall include, if requested by the Document Custodian, billing account numbers maintained by the Customer with such shipper(s) to allow for direct billing of the related charges to the Company). The Company shall arrange for the provision of such services at its sole cost and expense (or, at the Document Custodian’s option, reimburse the Document Custodian for all costs and expenses incurred by the Document Custodian consistent with such instructions) and will maintain such insurance against loss or damage to Collateral Files or other loan documents as the Company deems appropriate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is hereby expressly agreed that in the absence of express written instruction from the Company pursuant to the preceding terms, shipment may be made by the Document Custodian in any instance by means of any recognized overnight delivery or shipping service (it being hereby expressly acknowledged that United Parcel Service is one such recognized service, without implied limitation). All costs and risks of shipment shall be borne by the Company, and it is hereby expressly agreed that in no event shall the Document Custodian have any liability for any losses or damages to any Person, arising out of actions of the Document Custodian consistent with the instructions of the Company (on behalf of itself or a Subsidiary). Any costs of shipment that may be incurred or paid by the Document Custodian from time to time may be billed by the Document Custodian to the Company on a monthly basis and shall be due and payable when billed.




Section 8. Fees of the Document Custodian. It is understood that the Document Custodian will charge such fees for its services under this Agreement as are set forth in a separate agreement (the “Fee Schedule”)[1] between the Document Custodian and the Company, the payment of which, together with the Document Custodian’s reasonable expenses (as described below) in connection herewith, shall be solely the obligation of the Company. The final form of such Fee Schedule (as amended or modified by the parties) shall be binding upon the parties, whether or not such Fee Schedule has been executed by the parties.

The Company agrees to pay or reimburse to the Document Custodian upon its request from time to time, any and all reasonable and documented costs, disbursements, expenses and indemnification amounts (including without limitation reasonable and documented fees and expenses of legal counsel, agents and experts) paid or incurred by the Document Custodian, in connection with (i) the preparation or execution of this Agreement, (ii) the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the administration of this Agreement, (iv) the performance by the Document Custodian of its duties and services under this Agreement or (v) the enforcement by the Document Custodian of this Agreement and its indemnification rights hereunder, from time to time (including without limitation costs and expenses of any legal or other action deemed necessary by the Document Custodian to collect any amounts owing to it under this Agreement).

The Document Custodian shall not be responsible for the fees and expenses of any successor document custodian. Upon delivery of the Collateral Files to any successor document custodian or to the Company as provided in this paragraph, all duties and

B.The Company may at any time and without cause remove and discharge the Document Custodian from the performance of its duties under this Agreement upon at least sixty (60) days’ written notice to from the Company to the Document Custodian. Such removal shall take effect upon (i) the appointment of a successor document custodian by the Company, and (ii) delivery of all the Collateral Files to the successor document custodian, which delivery shall be subject to, and shall be made promptly after, payment of the Document Custodian’s unpaid fees, expenses and indemnification amounts. The payment of such successor document custodian’s fees and expenses and all costs and expenses in connection with such transfer shall be the sole responsibility of the Company. If a successor document custodian is not appointed by the Company within the aforementioned sixty (60) days, the Document Custodian may, at the expense of the Company, deliver all the Collateral Files to the Company. Upon delivery of the Collateral Files to the Company as provided in this paragraph, all duties and obligations of the Document Custodian shall cease and terminate. The payment of all costs and expenses relating to the transfer of the Collateral Files (including any shipping costs) upon termination shall be the sole responsibility of the Company.
C.This Agreement shall terminate on the date on which the Company notifies the Document Custodian in writing that the Agreement is terminated.
