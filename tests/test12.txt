SECTION 1.04 Accounting Terms; GAAP. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature shall be construed in accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time; provided that, if the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that the Borrower requests an amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the Effective Date in GAAP or in the application or interpretation thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then the Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree to enter into negotiations in good faith in order to amend such provisions of the Agreement so as to equitably reflect such change to comply with GAAP with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the Borrower’s financial condition shall be the same after such change to comply with GAAP as if such change had not been made; provided, however, until such amendments to equitably reflect such changes are effective and agreed to by the Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, the Borrower’s compliance with such financial covenants shall be determined on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change in GAAP becomes effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower covenants and agrees with the Lenders that whether or not the Borrower may at any time adopt Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification 825, all determinations relating to fair value accounting for liabilities or compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be made on the basis that the Borrower has not adopted Accounting Standard Codification 825.

At any time, any reference in the definition of the term “Agreed Foreign Currency” or in any other provision of this Agreement to the Currency of any particular nation means the lawful currency of such nation at such time whether or not the name of such Currency is the same as it was on the Effective Date. Except as provided in
53
    
Section 2.09(b) and the last sentence of Section 2.16(a), for purposes of determining (i) whether the amount of any Multicurrency Borrowing or Letter of Credit then outstanding or to be borrowed at the same time as such Borrowing would exceed the aggregate amount of Multicurrency Commitments, (ii) the aggregate unutilized amount of the Multicurrency Commitments, (iii) the Multicurrency Credit Exposure, (iv) the LC Exposure, (v) the Covered Debt Amount and (vi) the Borrowing Base or the Value of any Portfolio Investment, the outstanding principal amount of any Borrowing or Letter of Credit that is denominated in any Foreign Currency or the Value of any Portfolio Investment that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the Foreign Currency of such Borrowing, Letter of Credit or Portfolio Investment, as the case may be, determined as of the date of such Borrowing or Letter of Credit (determined in accordance with the last sentence of the definition of the term “Interest Period”) or the date of valuation of such Portfolio Investment, as the case may be; provided that in connection with the delivery of any Borrowing Base Certificate pursuant to Section 5.01(d) or (e), such amounts shall be determined as of the date of delivery of such Borrowing Base Certificate. Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing or Loan an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing or Loan is denominated in a Foreign Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Foreign Currency Equivalent of such Dollar Amount (rounded to the nearest 1,000 units of such Foreign Currency). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of determining compliance with any basket in this Agreement, in no event shall any Obligor be deemed to not be in compliance with any such basket solely as a result of a change in exchange rates.
(b)    Special Provisions Relating to Euro. Each obligation hereunder of any party hereto that is denominated in the National Currency of a state that is not a Participating Member State on the Effective Date shall, effective from the date on which such state becomes a Participating Member State, be redenominated in Euro in accordance with the legislation of the European Union applicable to the European Monetary Union; provided that, if and to the extent that any such legislation provides that any such obligation of any such party payable within such Participating Member State by crediting an account of the creditor can be paid by the debtor either in Euros or such National Currency, such party shall be entitled to pay or repay such amount either in Euros or in such National Currency. If the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in this Agreement with respect to an Agreed Foreign Currency of any country that becomes a Participating Member State after the date on which such currency becomes an Agreed Foreign Currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the Euro, such convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis effective as of and from the date on which such state becomes a Participating Member State; provided that, with respect to any Borrowing denominated in such currency that is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect at the end of the Interest Period therefor.
Without prejudice to the liabilities of the Borrower to the Lenders and the Lenders to the Borrower under or pursuant to this Agreement, each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time, in consultation with the Borrower, reasonably specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction or changeover to the Euro in any country that becomes a Participating
54
    
Member State after the Effective Date; provided that the Administrative Agent shall provide the Borrower and the Lenders with prior notice of the proposed change with an explanation of such change in sufficient time to permit the Borrower and the Lenders an opportunity to respond to such proposed change.
(c)    Exchange Rates; Currency Equivalents. The Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall determine the Spot Rates as of each Revaluation Date to be used for calculating Dollar Equivalent amounts of Loans, Letters of Credit and Credit Exposure denominated in Agreed Foreign Currencies. Such Spot Rates shall become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Spot Rates employed in converting any amounts between the applicable currencies until the next Revaluation Date to occur. Except for purposes of financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 or calculating financial covenants hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount as so determined by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable. Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing, conversion, continuation or prepayment of a Eurocurrency Loan, RFR Loan or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing, Eurocurrency Loan, RFR Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Foreign Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Agreed Foreign Currency, with 0.5 of a unit being rounded upward).
SECTION 1.06 Outstanding Indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any Indebtedness is repaid, redeemed, repurchased, defeased or otherwise retired or discharged, such Indebtedness shall be deemed to be paid off and not to be outstanding for any purpose hereunder to the extent of the amount of such repayment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, retirement or discharge.
SECTION 1.07 Rates; LIBOR Screen Rate Notification. The interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is determined by reference to Eurocurrency Rate, which, in the case of LIBOR Quoted Currencies is derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), the regulatory supervisor of LIBOR’s administrator, the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administration, the “IBA”), announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the IBA for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. In March 2021, both the FCA and IBA issued statements confirming that the publication of Pounds Sterling, CHF, Euros and Japanese Yen LIBOR Screen Rate (all tenors) and Dollar LIBOR Screen Rate (1-Week and 2-Month) shall cease at the end of 2021. The IBA stated it will publish the remaining Dollar LIBOR Screen Rate tenors (1-, 3-, 6- and 12-Month) until the end of June 2023. As a result, commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate for the Loans denominated in LIBOR Quoted Currencies. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector
55
    
industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, Section 2.12(d) provides the mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to Section 2.12(d), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on a Eurocurrency Loan or RFR Loan is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of “LIBOR Screen Rate,” “Eurocurrency Rate” or “Daily Simple RFR” or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 2.12(d), whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 2.12(d), including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the London interbank offered rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.

In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
(c)    Limitations on Amounts. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure of the Issuing Bank (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed $25,000,000, (ii) the total Multicurrency Credit Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitment and (iii) the total Covered Debt Amount shall not exceed the Borrowing Base then in effect.
(d)    Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the date twelve months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, twelve months after the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit, so long as such renewal or extension occurs within three months of such then-current expiration date); provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide (pursuant to customary “evergreen” provisions) for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods; provided, further, that (x) in no event shall any Letter of Credit have an expiration date that is later than the Revolver Termination Date unless the Borrower (1) Cash Collateralizes such Letter of Credit on or prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Revolver Termination Date (by reference to the undrawn face amount of such Letter of Credit) that will remain outstanding as of the close of business on the Revolver Termination Date and (2) pays in full, on or prior to the Revolver Termination Date, all commissions required to be paid with respect to any such Letter of Credit through the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit and (y) no Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date after the Maturity Date.
(e)    Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by the Issuing Bank, and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Multicurrency Lender, and each Multicurrency Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Multicurrency Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, provided that no Multicurrency Lender shall be required to purchase a
60
    
participation in a Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.04(e) if (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 would not be satisfied in respect of a Borrowing at the time such Letter of Credit was issued and (y) the Required Multicurrency Lenders shall have so notified the Issuing Bank in writing and shall not have subsequently determined that the circumstances giving rise to such conditions not being satisfied no longer exist.
In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Multicurrency Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank in respect of Letters of Credit promptly upon the request of the Issuing Bank at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Multicurrency Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Multicurrency Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to paragraph (f), the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that the Multicurrency Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Multicurrency Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f)    Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time, provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with a Eurocurrency Borrowing having an Interest Period of one month’s duration of either Class or an RFR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Eurocurrency Borrowing having an Interest Period of one month’s duration or an RFR Borrowing, as applicable.
If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage thereof.
61
    
(g)    Obligations Absolute. The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, and (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower’s obligations hereunder.
None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank, or any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Bank or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank’s gross negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that:
(i)    the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit;
(ii)    the Issuing Bank shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and
(iii)    this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the Issuing Bank when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing).
(h)    Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or by email) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC
62
    
Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(i)    Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Eurocurrency Loans having an Interest Period of one month’s duration (or, if such LC Disbursement is denominated in Pounds Sterling or Swiss Francs, the rate per annum then applicable to RFR Loans for the applicable Currency); provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement within two Business Days following the date when due pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, then the provisions of Section 2.11(cd) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(j)    Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. In addition to the foregoing, if a Lender becomes, and during the period in which it remains, a Defaulting Lender, and any Default has arisen from a failure of the Borrower to comply with Section 2.17(c), then the Issuing Bank may, upon prior written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, resign as Issuing Bank, effective at the close of business New York City time on a date specified in such notice (which date may not be less than five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice). On or after the effective date of any such resignation, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may, by written agreement, appoint a successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement under any of the foregoing circumstances shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.10(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of the Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(k)    Cash Collateralization. If the Borrower shall be required or shall elect, as the case may be, to provide cover for LC Exposure pursuant to Section 2.04(d), Section 2.09(b), Section 2.17(c)(ii) or the last paragraph of Article VII, the Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize such LC Exposure. Such Cash Collateral shall be held by the Administrative Agent
63
    
in the first instance as collateral for LC Exposure under this Agreement and thereafter for the payment of the “Secured Obligations” as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement, and for these purposes the Borrower hereby grants a security interest to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Lenders in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other property held therein.
SECTION 2.05 Funding of Borrowings.
(a)    Funding by Lenders. Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., Local Time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(f) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.
(b)    Presumption by the Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and, in reliance upon such assumption, the Administrative Agent may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in the corresponding Currency with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, (x) with respect to Eurocurrency Borrowings, the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Loans having an Interest Period of one month’s duration and (y) with respect to Borrowings denominated in Pounds Sterling or Swiss Francs, the interest rate applicable to RFR Loans denominated in such Currency, as applicable. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Nothing in this paragraph shall relieve any Lender of its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder, and shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 2.06 Interest Elections.
(a)    Elections by the Borrower for Borrowings. Subject to Section 2.03(d), the Loans constituting each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, subject to Section 2.06(e), the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such
64
    
Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section; provided, however that (i) a Borrowing of a Class may only be continued or converted into a Borrowing of the same Class, (ii) a Borrowing denominated in one Currency may not be continued as, or converted into, a Borrowing in a different Currency, (iii) no Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may be continued if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposures would exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments and (iv) a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may not be converted into a Borrowing of a different Type. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders of the respective Class holding the Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b)    Notice of Elections. To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by delivery of a signed Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent or by telephone (followed promptly, but no later than the close of business on the date of such request, by a signed Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable.
(c)    Content of Interest Election Requests. Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)    the Borrowing (including the Class) to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii)    the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii)    in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
(iv)    if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period” and permitted under Section 2.02(d).
(d)    Notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders. Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
65
    
(e)    Failure to Elect; Events of Default. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, (i) if such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a Eurocurrency Borrowing of the same Class having an Interest Period of one month’s duration and (ii) if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing no outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowing may have an Interest Period of more than one month’s duration.
SECTION 2.07 Termination, Reduction or Increase of the Commitments.
(a)    Scheduled Termination. Unless previously terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on the Revolver Termination Date the Commitments shall automatically be reduced to an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Loans and LC Exposure of all Lenders outstanding on the Revolver Termination Date and thereafter to an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Loans and LC Exposure outstanding after giving effect to each payment of principal and each expiration or termination of a Letter of Credit hereunder; provided that, for clarity, except as expressly provided for herein (including, without limitation, Section 2.04(e)), no Lender shall have any obligation to make new Loans or to issue, amend or renew an existing Letter of Credit on or after the Revolver Termination Date, and Loans outstanding on the Revolver Termination Date shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date in accordance with Section 2.08.
(b)    Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments ratably among each Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.07(b) shall be in a minimum amount of at least $1,000,000 (or an amount less than $1,000,000 if the Commitments are being reduced to zero) and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans of any Class in accordance with Section 2.09, the total Credit Exposures of such Class would exceed the total Commitments of such Class.
(c)    Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments of a Class delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.
66
    
(d)    Effect of Termination or Reduction. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of a Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.
(e)    Increase of the Commitments.
(i)    Requests for Increase by Borrower. The Borrower shall have the right, at any time after the Effective Date but prior to the Revolver Termination Date, to propose that the Commitments of a Class hereunder be increased (each such proposed increase being a “Commitment Increase”) by notice to the Administrative Agent specifying each existing Lender (each an “Increasing Lender”) and/or each additional lender (each an “Assuming Lender”) that shall have agreed to an additional Commitment and the date on which such increase is to be effective (the “Commitment Increase Date”), which date shall be a Business Day at least three Business Days (or such lesser period as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree) after delivery of such notice and at least thirty (30) days prior to the Revolver Termination Date; provided that, subject to the foregoing, each Commitment Increase shall become effective only upon satisfaction of the following conditions:
(A)    the minimum amount of the Commitment of any Assuming Lender, and the minimum amount of the increase of the Commitment of any Increasing Lender, as part of such Commitment Increase shall be $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, in such other amounts as agreed by the Administrative Agent);
(B)    immediately after giving effect to such Commitment Increase, the total Commitments of all of the Lenders hereunder shall not exceed $1,200,000,000;
(C)    each Assuming Lender and the Commitment Increase shall be consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
(D)    no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such Commitment Increase Date or shall result from the proposed Commitment Increase; and
(E)    the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (other than any representation or warranty already qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, which shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Commitment Increase Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date).
67
    
For the avoidance of doubt, no Lender shall be obligated to agree to an increased Commitment requested by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.07(e).
(ii)    Effectiveness of Commitment Increase by Borrower. On the Commitment Increase Date for any Commitment Increase, each Assuming Lender, if any, providing a Commitment as part of such Commitment Increase shall become a Lender hereunder as of such Commitment Increase Date with a Commitment in the amount set forth in the agreement referred to in Section 2.07(e)(ii)(y) and the Commitment of each Increasing Lender, if any, increasing its Commitment as part of such Commitment Increase shall be increased as of such Commitment Increase Date to the amount set forth in the agreement referred to in Section 2.07(e)(ii)(y); provided that:
(x)    the Administrative Agent shall have received on or prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Commitment Increase Date a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Borrower stating that each of the applicable conditions to such Commitment Increase set forth in the foregoing paragraph (i) has been satisfied; and
(y)    each Assuming Lender and/or Increasing Lender providing or increasing a Commitment, respectively, as part of such Commitment Increase shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent, on or prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time on such Commitment Increase Date, an agreement, duly executed by each such Assuming Lender and/or Increasing Lender, as applicable, and the Borrower, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which each such Assuming Lender and/or Increasing Lender shall, effective as of such Commitment Increase Date, provide or increase its Commitment of the applicable Class, respectively.
Promptly following satisfaction of such conditions, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders (including any Assuming Lenders) thereof and of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase Date by facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system.
(iii)    Recordation into Register. Upon its receipt of an agreement referred to in clause (ii)(y) above executed by each Assuming Lender and/or each Increasing Lender providing or increasing a Commitment, respectively, as part of such Commitment Increase, together with the certificate referred to in clause (ii)(x) above, the Administrative Agent shall, if such agreement referred to in clause (ii)(y) has been completed, (x) accept such agreement, (y) record the information contained therein in the Register and (z) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.
(iv)    Adjustments of Borrowings upon Effectiveness of Increase. On each Commitment Increase Date, the Borrower shall (A) prepay the outstanding Loans of the affected Class (if any) in full, (B) simultaneously borrow new Loans of such Class hereunder in an amount equal to such prepayment; provided that with respect to subclauses (A) and (B), (x) the prepayment to, and borrowing from, any existing Lender shall be effected by book entry to the extent that any portion of the amount prepaid to
68
    
such Lender will be subsequently borrowed from such Lender and (y) the existing Lenders, the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders shall make and receive payments among themselves, in a manner acceptable to the Administrative Agent, so that, after giving effect thereto, the Loans are held ratably by the Lenders of such Class in accordance with the respective Commitments of such Class of such Lenders (after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) and (C) pay to the Lenders of such Class the amounts, if any, payable under Section 2.14 as a result of any such prepayment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise consented in writing by the Borrower, no Commitment Increase Date shall occur on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period. Concurrently therewith, the Lenders with Multicurrency Commitments shall be deemed to have adjusted their participation interests in any outstanding Letters of Credit so that such interests are held ratably in accordance with their Multicurrency Commitments as so increased. The Administrative Agent shall amend Schedule 1.01(b) to reflect the aggregate amount of each Lender’s Commitments (including Increasing Lenders and Assuming Lenders). Each reference to Schedule 1.01(b) in this Agreement shall be to Schedule 1.01(b) as amended pursuant to this Section.
(v)    Terms of Loans issued on the Commitment Increase Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms and provisions of any new Loans issued by any Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, and the Commitment Increase of any Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, shall be identical to terms and provisions of the Loans issued by, and the Commitments of, the Lenders immediately prior to the applicable Commitment Increase Date.
SECTION 2.08 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(a)    Repayment. Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of this Agreement, the Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders the outstanding principal amount of each Class of Loans and all other amounts due and owing hereunder and under the other Loan Documents on the Maturity Date.
(b)    Manner of Payment. Prior to any repayment or prepayment of any Borrowings hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or e-mail) of such selection not later than the time set forth in Section 2.09(e) prior to the scheduled date of such repayment. Subject to Section 2.09 and to the proviso to Section 2.16(c), if the repayment or prepayment is denominated in Dollars and the Class to be repaid or prepaid is specified (or if no Class is specified and there is only one Class of Loans with Borrowings in Dollars outstanding), such repayment or prepayment shall be applied ratably between or among, as applicable, the Loans of such Class (based on the outstanding principal amount of such Loans), in each case first to repay or prepay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Loans and second to repay or prepay the remaining Borrowings denominated in Dollars of such Loans in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Period (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest period to be repaid or prepaid first). Subject to Section 2.09 and to the proviso to Section 2.16(c), if the repayment or prepayment is denominated in Dollars and the Class to be repaid or prepaid is not specified, such repayment or prepayment shall be applied (i) ratably between or among, as applicable, the Dollar denominated Loans of the Multicurrency Lenders
69
    
(based on the then outstanding principal amounts of such Dollar denominated Loans), in each case (x) first to repay or prepay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of the Multicurrency Lenders, and (y) then second to repay or prepay the remaining Borrowings denominated in Dollars of the Multicurrency Lenders in the order in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowings with the shortest remaining Interest Periods to be repaid first), and (ii) once the outstanding principal amount of all Dollar denominated Loans of the Multicurrency Lenders is paid in full, ratably between or among, as applicable, the Loans of the Dollar Lenders (based on the then outstanding principal amount of such Loans), in each case (x) first to repay or prepay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of the Dollar Lenders and (y) then second to repay or prepay the remaining Borrowings of the Dollar Lenders in order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowings with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first). Subject to Section 2.09 and to the proviso Section 2.16(c), if the repayment or prepayment is denominated in a particular Agreed Foreign Currency, such repayment or prepayment shall be applied ratably between or among, as applicable, any remaining Borrowings denominated in such Agreed Foreign Currency (based on the then outstanding principal amount of such Loans), in each case in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first). Each payment specified as a payment on account of the Pro-Rata Borrowings shall be applied ratably between the Dollar Loans and the Multicurrency Loans (based on the then outstanding principal amount of such Loans), in each case in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first). Each payment of a Borrowing of a Class shall be applied ratably to the Loans of such Class included in such Borrowing.
(c)    Maintenance of Records by Lenders. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts and Currency of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(d)    Maintenance of Records by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for account of the Lenders with respect to each Loan and each Lender’s share thereof.
(e)    Effect of Entries. The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence, absent manifest error, of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
70
    
(f)    Promissory Notes. Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its permitted registered assigns) and in a form attached hereto as Exhibit C. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its permitted registered assigns).
SECTION 2.09 Prepayment of Loans.
(a)    Optional Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time (but subject to Section 2.09(e)) to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or fee (but subject to Section 2.14), subject to the requirements of this Section. Each prepayment in part under this Section 2.09(a) shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is then outstanding).
(b)    Mandatory Prepayments due to Changes in Exchange Rates.
(i)    Determination of Amount Outstanding. On each Quarterly Date and, in addition, promptly upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of a Currency Valuation Notice (as defined below), the Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposure. For the purpose of this determination, the outstanding principal amount of any Loan or LC Exposure that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount in the Foreign Currency of such Loan or LC Exposure, determined as of such Quarterly Date or, in the case of a Currency Valuation Notice received by the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on a Business Day, on such Business Day or, in the case of a Currency Valuation Notice otherwise received, on the first Business Day after such Currency Valuation Notice is received. Upon making such determination, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Multicurrency Lenders and the applicable Borrower thereof.
(ii)    Prepayment. If, on the date of such determination, the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposure minus the Cash Collateralized LC Exposure exceeds 105% of the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall prepay the Multicurrency Loans (and/or Cash Collateralize LC Exposure as contemplated by Section 2.04(k)) within 15 Business Days following such date of determination in such aggregate amounts as shall be necessary so that after giving effect thereto the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposure does not exceed the Multicurrency Commitments.
For purposes hereof, “Currency Valuation Notice” means a notice given by the Required Multicurrency Lenders to the Administrative Agent stating that such notice is a “Currency Valuation Notice” and requesting that the Administrative Agent determine the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposure. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to make more
71
    
than one valuation determination pursuant to Currency Valuation Notices within any rolling three month period.
Any prepayment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be applied first, to the Multicurrency Loans outstanding and second, as cover for LC Exposure.
(c)    Mandatory Prepayments due to Borrowing Base Deficiency. In the event that (i) the amount of the total Dollar Credit Exposure exceeds the total Dollar Commitments and/or (ii) the amount of the total Multicurrency Credit Exposure exceeds the total Multicurrency Commitments (other than as a result of a change in exchange rates pursuant to Section 2.09(b)), the Borrower shall prepay Loans (and/or Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.04(k)) in such amounts as shall be necessary so that (x) in the case of clause (i), the amount of total Dollar Credit Exposure does not exceed the total Dollar Commitments and (y) in the case of clause (ii), the amount of total Multicurrency Credit Exposure does not exceed the total Multicurrency Commitments. In the event that at any time any Borrowing Base Deficiency shall exist, promptly (but in no event later than 5 Business Days), the Borrower shall either prepay (x) the Loans (and/or Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.04(k)) so that the Borrowing Base Deficiency is promptly cured or (y) the Loans and the Other Covered Indebtedness in such amounts as shall be necessary so that such Borrowing Base Deficiency is promptly cured; provided, that as among the Loans (and Letters of Credit) on the one hand and the Other Covered Indebtedness on the other hand, such prepayment shall be at least ratable (based on the outstanding principal amount of such Indebtedness) as to payments of Loans (and Letters of Credit) in relation to Other Covered Indebtedness); provided, that if within such 5 Business Day period, the Borrower shall present to the Administrative Agent a reasonably feasible plan, which plan is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will enable any such Borrowing Base Deficiency to be cured within 30 Business Days of the occurrence of such Borrowing Base Deficiency (which 30-Business Day period shall include the 5 Business Days permitted for delivery of such plan), then such prepayment or reduction shall be effected in accordance with such plan (subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the limitations as to the allocation of such prepayments set forth above in this Section 2.09(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall pay interest in accordance with Section 2.11(cd) for so long as the Covered Debt Amount exceeds the Borrowing Base during such 30-Business Day period. For clarity, in the event that the Borrowing Base Deficiency is not cured prior to the end of such 5-Business Day period (or, if applicable, such 30-Business Day period), it shall constitute an Event of Default under clause (a) of Article VII.
(d)    Mandatory Prepayments due to Certain Events Following Availability Period. Subject to Section 2.09(e):
(i)    Asset Sales. In the event that any Obligor shall receive any Net Asset Sale Proceeds at any time after the Availability Period, the Borrower shall, no later than the third Business Day following the receipt of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds, prepay the Loans in an amount equal to such Net Asset Sale Proceeds (and the Commitments shall be permanently reduced by such amount); provided, that with respect to Asset Sales of assets that are not Portfolio Investments, the Borrower shall not be required to prepay the
72
    
Loans unless and until (and to the extent that) the aggregate Net Asset Sale Proceeds relating to all such Asset Sales are greater than $2,000,000.
(ii)    Returns of Capital. In the event that any Obligor shall receive any Net Return of Capital at any time after the Availability Period, the Borrower shall, no later than the third Business Day following the receipt of such Net Return of Capital, prepay the Loans in an amount equal to 100% of such Net Return of Capital (and the Commitments shall be permanently reduced by such amount).
(iii)    Equity Issuances. In the event that the Borrower shall receive any Cash proceeds from the issuance of Equity Interests of the Borrower at any time after the Availability Period, the Borrower shall, no later than the third Business Day following the receipt of such Cash proceeds, prepay the Loans in an amount equal to 75% of such Cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions or other similar payments and other reasonable costs, fees, premiums and expenses directly associated therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses, (and the Commitments shall be permanently reduced by such amount).
(iv)    Indebtedness. In the event that any Obligor shall receive any Cash proceeds from the issuance of Indebtedness (excluding Hedging Agreements permitted by Section 6.01 and other Indebtedness permitted by Section 6.01(a), (e), (f), (g) and (j)) at any time after the Availability Period, such Obligor shall, no later than the third Business Day following the receipt of such Cash proceeds, prepay the Loans in an amount equal to 100% of such Cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions or other similar payments and other reasonable costs, fees, commissions, premiums and expenses directly associated therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses (and the Commitments shall be permanently reduced by such amount).
(e)    Mandatory Prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans. If the Loans to be prepaid pursuant to Section 2.09(d)(ii) are Eurocurrency Loans, the Borrower may defer such prepayment (and permanent Commitment reduction) until the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loans, so long as the Borrower deposits an amount equal to an amount required to be prepaid, no later than the third Business Day following the receipt of such amount, into a segregated collateral account in the name and under the dominion and control (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the Uniform Commercial Code) of the Administrative Agent pending application of such amount to the prepayment of the Loans (and permanent reduction of the Commitments) on the last day of such Interest Period.
(f)    Payments Following Availability Period or During an Event of Default. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Section 2.08 or this Section 2.09 or otherwise herein, following the end of the Availability Period (with respect to clauses (i) and (ii)) or following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (with respect to clause (iii)):
(i)    No optional prepayment of the Loans made of any Class shall be permitted unless at such time, the Borrower also prepays its Loans of the other Class or, in the case
73
    
of a prepayment of Dollar Loans and to the extent no Multicurrency Loans are outstanding, provides Cash Collateral as contemplated by Section 2.04(k) for the outstanding Letters of Credit, which prepayment (and Cash Collateral) shall be made on a pro-rata basis (based on the outstanding principal amounts of such Indebtedness) between each outstanding Class of Credit Exposure;
(ii)    any prepayment of Loans in Dollars required to be made in connection with any of the events specified in Section 2.09(d) shall be applied ratably between the Dollar Lenders and the Multicurrency Lenders based on the then outstanding principal amounts of Loans denominated in Dollars; provided, that, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each prepayment in an Agreed Foreign Currency (including as a result of the Borrower’s receipt of proceeds from a prepayment event in such Agreed Foreign Currency (it being the understanding that any receipt of proceeds in an Agreed Foreign Currency shall first be used to make a payment on account of the Loans denominated in such Agreed Foreign Currency)) shall be applied ratably among just the Multicurrency Lenders to prepay the Loans denominated in such Agreed Foreign Currency and, if after such payment, if applicable, or otherwise, the balance of the Loans denominated in such Agreed Foreign Currency remaining is zero, then, if there are any remaining proceeds, the Borrower shall prepay (in Dollars) the remaining Loans on a pro rata basis (based on the aggregate outstanding Dollar Equivalent principal amount of such Loans) between each outstanding Class of Loans; and
(iii)    Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then any payment or repayment of the Loans shall be made and applied ratably (based on the aggregate Dollar Equivalents of the outstanding principal amounts of such Loans) between Dollar Loans, Multicurrency Loans and Letters of Credit.
(g)    Notices, Etc. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing or by telephone (followed promptly by written confirmation) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing under Section 2.09(a), not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time (or, in the case of a prepayment of a Eurocurrency denominated in a Foreign Currency under Section 2.09(a), 12:00 a.m. London time), three (3) Business Days before the date of prepayment or, (ii) in the case of repayment or prepayment of an RFR Borrowing under Section 2.09(a), not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, five (5) Business Days before the date of repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing under Section 2.09(a), or in the case of any prepayment under Section 2.09(b), (c), or (d), not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of prepayment, or (iiiiv) in each case of the notice periods described in clauses (i) and, (ii) and (iii), such lesser period as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree with respect to notices given in connection with any of the events specified in Section 2.09(d)(ii). Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided, that, (1) if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.07(c), then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination or reduction is revoked in accordance with Section 2.07(c)
74
    
and (2) any such notices given in connection with any of the events specified in Section 2.09(cd) may be conditioned upon (x) the consummation of the Asset Sale or the issuance of Equity Interests or Indebtedness (as applicable) or (y) the receipt of net cash proceeds from Asset Sales or Net Returns of Capital. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. In the event the Borrower is required to make any concurrent prepayments under both paragraph (c) and also another paragraph of this Section 2.09, any such prepayments shall be applied toward a prepayment pursuant to paragraph (c) before any prepayment pursuant to any other paragraph of this Section 2.09. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.11 and shall be made in the manner specified in Section 2.08(b).
(h)    RIC Tax Distributions. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Net Asset Sale Proceeds and Net Return of Capital required to be applied to the prepayment of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.09(d) shall exclude the amounts estimated in good faith by the Borrower to be necessary for the Borrower to make distributions on account of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds and Net Returns of Capital sufficient in amount to achieve the objectives set forth in (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 6.05(b)(1) hereof solely to the extent that the Tax Amount in or with respect to any taxable year (or any calendar year, as relevant) is increased as a result of the receipt of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds or Net Return of Capital, as the case may be.
SECTION 2.10 Fees.
(a)    Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue (i) for the period beginning on the Effective Date to and including the earlier of the date such Lender’s Commitment terminates and the date that is six months after the Effective Date, at a rate equal to 0.375% per annum on the daily unused portion of the Commitment of such Lender as of the close of business on such day and (ii) for the period beginning the day after the date that is six months after the Effective Date to and including the earlier of the date such Lender’s Commitment terminates and the Revolver Termination Date, at a rate equal to (x) 0.50% per annum on the daily unused amount of the Dollar Commitments and Multicurrency Commitments, as applicable, of such Lender as of the close of business on such day if the daily unused amount of the Dollar Commitments and the Multicurrency Commitments is greater than sixty six and two-thirds percent (66 and 2/3%) of such Lender’s Dollar Commitment and Multicurrency Commitment, as applicable and (y) 0.375% per annum on the daily unused amount of the Dollar Commitments and Multicurrency Commitments, as applicable of such Lender as of the close of business on such day if the daily unused amount of the Dollar Commitment and Multicurrency Commitment is equal to or less than sixty six and two-thirds percent (66 and 2/3%). Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears (x) within one Business Day after each Quarterly Date and (y) on the earlier of the date the Commitments of the respective Class terminate and the Revolver Termination Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees, the Commitments
75
    
of any Class of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Loans of such Class and LC Exposure of such Class of all Lenders.
(b)    Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for account of each Multicurrency Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin applicable to interest on Eurocurrency Loans (or, if such Letter of Credit is denominated in Pounds Sterling or Swiss Francs, RFR Loans) on the average daily amount of such Lender’s LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s Multicurrency Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of one-half of one percent (0.50%) per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank’s standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including each Quarterly Date shall be payable on the third Business Day following such Quarterly Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees with respect to the Letters of Credit shall be payable on earlier of the Revolver Termination Date and the date on which all Multicurrency Commitments are otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms hereof (such earlier date, the “termination date”) and the Borrower shall pay any such fees that have accrued and that are unpaid on the termination date and, in the event any Letters of Credit shall be outstanding that have expiration dates after the termination date, the Borrower shall prepay on the termination date the full amount of the participation and fronting fees that will accrue on such Letters of Credit subsequent to the termination date through but not including the date such outstanding Letters of Credit are scheduled to expire (and in that connection, the Multicurrency Lenders agree not later than the date two Business Days after the date on which the last such Letter of Credit shall expire or be terminated to rebate to the Borrower the excess, if any, of the aggregate participation and fronting fees that ultimate accrue through the date of such expiration or termination). Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 Business Days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(c)    Administrative Agent Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
(d)    Payment of Fees. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars and immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of facility fees and
76
    
participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.11 Interest.
(a)    ABR Loans. The Loans constituting each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
(b)    Eurocurrency Loans. The Loans constituting each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for the related Interest Period for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.
(c)    RFR Loans. The Loans constituting each RFR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for the applicable Currency plus the Applicable Margin.
(ed)    Default Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) automatically, if any Event of Default described in clause (a), (b), (d) (only with respect to Section 6.07), (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, or if the Covered Debt Amount exceeds the Borrowing Base during the 5-Business Day period (or, if applicable, the 30-Business Day period) referred to in Section 2.09(c), and (y) upon the demand of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders when any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the interest rates applicable to the Loans shall accrue, and any fee or other amount due and payable (after giving effect to any grace or cure period) by the Borrower hereunder shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of principal of any Loan, 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above, (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% plus (x) if such other amount is denominated in Dollars, the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section or, (y) if such other amount is denominated in a Foreign Currency (other than Pounds Sterling or Swiss Francs), the rate applicable to the applicable Eurocurrency Loans as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section or (z) if such other amount is denominated in Pounds Sterling or Swiss Francs, the rate applicable to RFR Loans for the applicable Currency as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section.
(de)    Payment of Interest. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan in the Currency in which such Loan is denominated and upon the Maturity Date; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (cd) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the Maturity Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Borrowing shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(cf)    Computation. All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (A) Eurocurrency Borrowings in Canadian Dollars or AUD shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) and, (B)
77
    
EurocurrencyRFR Borrowings in Pounds Sterling andshall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) and (C) ABR Borrowings, at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted Daily Simple RFR or Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.12 Eurocurrency Borrowing and RFR Borrowing Provisions.
(a)    If, at any time that the Administrative Agent shall seek to determine the relevant Screen Rate on (1) the Quotation Day for any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing or (2) the RFR Rate Day for an RFR Borrowing, the applicable Screen Rate shall not be available for such RFR Borrowing or such Interest Period for the applicable Currency with respect to such Eurocurrency Borrowing, as applicable, for any reason and the Administrative Agent shall determine that it is not possible to determine the Interpolated Rate (which conclusion shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error), (i) if the Administrative Agent is seeking to determine the relevant Screen Rate in the context of a Borrowing Request or an Interest Election Request electing the applicable Interest Period (A) if such Borrowing is in Dollars then either, at the Borrower’s election, (u) the applicable Borrowing Request or Interest Election Request shall be deemed ineffective or (v) such Borrowing shall be made as or converted to an ABR Borrowing at the Alternate Base Rate, (B) if such Borrowing is in Canadian Dollars then either, at the Borrower’s election, (w) such Borrowing Request or Interest Election Request shall be deemed ineffective or (x) such Borrowing shall be made as or converted to a Eurocurrency Borrowing for which the Eurocurrency Rate shall be equal to the Canadian Prime Rate and (C) if such Borrowing is in any Agreed Foreign Currency (other than Canadian Dollars) then either, at the Borrower’s election, (y) the applicable Borrowing Request or Interest Election Request shall be deemed ineffective or (z) such Borrowing shall be made as or converted to a Eurocurrency Borrowing (or, in the case of a Borrowing in Pounds Sterling or Swiss Francs, an RFR Borrowing) for which the Eurocurrency Rate or Daily Simple RFR, as applicable, shall be equal to the weighted average of the cost to each Lender to fund its pro rata share of such Borrowing (from whatever source and using whatever methodologies as such Lender may select in its reasonable discretion) (with respect to a Lender, the “COF Rate”, and with respect to the weighted average of the COF Rate applicable to each Lender for any Borrowing, the “Average COF Rate”) and (ii) if the Administrative Agent is seeking to determine the relevant Screen Rate in the context of a Eurocurrency Borrowing for which the Interest Period is continuing or an RFR Borrowing then (A) if such Borrowing is in Dollars such Borrowing shall continue as an ABR Borrowing at the Alternate Base Rate, (B) if such Borrowing is in Canadian Dollars then such Borrowing shall continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing for which the Eurocurrency Rate shall be equal to the Canadian Prime Rate and (C) if such Borrowing is in any Agreed Foreign Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), then such Borrowing shall continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing (or RFR Borrowing, as applicable) for which the Eurocurrency Rate (or Daily Simple RFR, as applicable) shall be the Average COF Rate.
78
    
(b)    Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of the Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Borrowing:
(i)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate, for a Loan in the applicable Currency for the applicable Interest Period; or (B) at any time for an RFR Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for the applicable Currency; or
(ii)    the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for a Loan in the applicable Currency for the applicable Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their respective Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; or (B) at any time for an RFR Borrowing, Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for the applicable Currency will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for the applicable Currency;
and, in each case, the provisions of Section 2.12(d) are not applicable, then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the affected Lenders by telephone, telecopy or e-mail as promptly as practicable thereafter setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request electing the applicable Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the applicable Currency shall be ineffective, (ii) in the case of any Borrowing Request requesting a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the applicable Currency for the applicable Interest Period, or an RFR Borrowing, as applicable, (A) if such Borrowing is in Dollars then either, at the Borrower’s election, (u) the applicable Borrowing Request shall be deemed ineffective or (v) such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing at the Alternate Base Rate, (B) if such Borrowing is in Canadian Dollars then either, at the Borrower’s election, (w) such Borrowing Request shall be deemed ineffective or (x) such Borrowing shall be made as a Eurocurrency Borrowing for which the Eurocurrency Rate shall be equal to the Canadian Prime Rate and (C) if such Borrowing is in any Agreed Foreign Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), then either, at the Borrower’s election, (y) the applicable Borrowing Request shall be deemed ineffective or (z) such Borrowing shall be made as or converted to a Eurocurrency Borrowing or RFR Borrowing, as applicable, for which the Eurocurrency Rate or Daily Simple RFR, as applicable, shall be equal to the Average COF Rate and (iii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing for which the Interest Period is continuing or an RFR Borrowing, as applicable, in each case, unless prepaid then (A) if such Borrowing is in Dollars such Borrowing shall continue as an ABR Borrowing at the Alternate Base Rate, (B) if such Borrowing is in Canadian Dollars then such Borrowing shall continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing for which the Eurocurrency Rate shall be equal to the Canadian Prime Rate and (C) if such Borrowing is in any Agreed Foreign Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), then such Borrowing shall continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing or RFR Borrowing, as applicable, for which the Eurocurrency Rate or Daily Simple RFR, as applicable, shall be equal to the Average
79
    
COF Rate.; provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other TypeTypes of Borrowings shall be permitted; provided, further that, in connection with any ABR Borrowing made pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.12(b), the determination of the Alternate Base Rate shall disregard clause (d) of the definition thereof.
(c)    Illegality. Without duplication of any other rights that any Lender has hereunder, if any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful for any Lender to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate (whether in Dollars or an Agreed Foreign Currency) or Daily Simple RFR or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate or Daily Simple RFR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Agreed Foreign Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to (x) make RFR Loans in the affected currency or currencies (y) make or continue Eurocurrency Loans in the affected Currencycurrency or currencies or, (z) in the case of Eurocurrency Loans in Dollars, to convert ABR Loans to Eurocurrency Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or continuing ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by the Administrative Agent by reference to the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x)(A) all applicable Eurocurrency Borrowings denominated in Dollars of such Lender shall automatically convert to ABR Borrowings and (B) all RFR Borrowings and Eurocurrency Borrowings denominated in the affected Agreed Foreign Currency of such Lender shall automatically convert to Dollars based on the Dollar Equivalent at such time and shall be an ABR Borrowing (the interest rate on which ABR Borrowings of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate), (1) with respect to Eurocurrency Borrowings, either (I) on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Borrowings to such day, or (II) immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Borrowings (in which event Borrower shall not be required to pay any yield maintenance, breakage or similar fees) or (2) with respect to RFR Borrowings, on the immediately succeeding Business Day and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted.
(d)    Effect of Benchmark Transition Event
80
    
(id)    Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon :

(i)    Replacing the LIBOR Screen Rate for Dollar-Denominated Loans. For Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars on the earlier of (x) the date that all Available Tenors of the LIBOR Screen Rate have either permanently or indefinitely ceased to be provided by IBA or have been announced by the FCA pursuant to public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative and (y) the Early Opt-in Effective Date, if the then-current Benchmark is the LIBOR Screen Rate, the Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any setting of such Benchmark on such day and all subsequent settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.
(ii)    Replacing the LIBOR Screen Rate for Other Foreign Currency-Denominated Loans and Future Benchmarks. On the earlier of (x) the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event orand (y) in respect of Loans denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, the date written notice of an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the is provided to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent and, the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the applicable Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrowerdate notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendmentBenchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. Any such amendment with respect to an Early Opt-in Election will become effective on the date that Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders accept such amendment. No replacement of the applicable Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement At any time that the administrator of the then-current Benchmark has permanently or indefinitely ceased to provide such Benchmark or such Benchmark has been announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark pursuant to public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative of the underlying market and economic reality that such Benchmark is intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored, the Borrower may revoke any request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Loans to be made, converted or continued that would bear interest by reference to such Benchmark until the Borrower’s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent that a Benchmark Replacement has replaced such Benchmark, and, failing that, (x) the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans, (y) any request by the Borrower for a
81
    
Eurocurrency Borrowing in an Agreed Foreign Currency (other than Canadian Dollars) shall be ineffective or (z) any request by the Borrower for a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars shall be converted to a Eurocurrency Borrowing at the Canadian Prime Rate. During the period referenced in the foregoing sentence, (a) the component of Alternate Base Rate based upon the Benchmark will not be used in any determination of Alternate Base Rate and (b) if any Eurocurrency Loan in any Currency is outstanding, (x) if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in Dollars, then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, at the Borrower’s election prior to such day: (1) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (2) be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars on such date, (y) if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in any Agreed Foreign Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, at the Borrower’s election prior to such day: (1) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (2) be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and (subject to the remainder of this subclause (2)) shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Loan) on such day (it being understood and agreed that if the Borrower does not so prepay such Loan on such day by 12:00 noon, Local Time, the Administrative Agent is authorized to effect such conversion of such Eurocurrency Loan into an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars) and, in the case of this subclause (2), upon any subsequent implementation of a Benchmark Replacement in respect of such Agreed Foreign Currency pursuant to this Section 2.12(d) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.and with the Borrower’s consent (which may be given in its sole discretion), such ABR Loan denominated in Dollars shall then be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in such original Currency (in an amount equal to the Foreign Currency Equivalent of such Loan) on the day of such implementation, giving effect to such Benchmark Replacement in respect of such Foreign Currency or (z) if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in Canadian Dollars, then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, at the Borrower’s election prior to such day: (1) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (2) be converted by the Administrative Agent to a Eurocurrency Loan where the Eurocurrency Rate shall be equal to the Canadian Prime Rate.
(iiiii)    Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent shallwill have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(iiiiv)    Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Start Date or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date and Benchmark Transition Start Date, (iix) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iiiy) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes and (ivz) the commencement or
82
    
conclusion of anyremoval or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark Unavailability Periodpursuant to clause (v) below. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.12(d), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party heretoto this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.12(d).
(iv)    Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Eurocurrency Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans based on the applicable Benchmark to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, (i) in the case of any request for a Eurocurrency Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans to be made in Dollars, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion into ABR Loans, (ii) in the case of any request for a Eurocurrency Borrowing of or conversion to Eurocurrency Loans to be made in any Foreign Currency based on the applicable Benchmark, such request will be deemed to be ineffective and (iii) in the case of any request for a continuation of Eurocurrency Loans to be made in any Foreign Currency based on the applicable Benchmark, such Borrowing shall be converted to Dollars based on the Dollar Equivalent at such time. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period, the component of ABR based upon the LIBOR Screen Rate will not be used in any determination of ABR.
(v)    Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. At any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (x) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or a LIBOR Screen Rate) then the Administrative Agent may remove any tenor of such Benchmark that is unavailable or non-representative for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings and (y) the Administrative Agent may reinstate any such previously removed tenor for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings if such Benchmark (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) settings.
SECTION 2.13 Increased Costs.
(a)    Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:
(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
83
    
or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate) or the Issuing Bank;
(ii)    subject any Lender to any Taxes (other than Covered Taxes and Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii)    impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans or RFR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or RFR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, upon the request of such Lender or Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that no Lender will claim from the Borrower the payment of any of the amounts referred to in this paragraph (a) if not generally claiming similar compensation from its other similar customers in similar circumstances.
(b)    Capital and Liquidity Requirements. If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity position), by an amount deemed to be material by such Lender or the Issuing Bank, then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)    Certificates from Lenders. A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth (in reasonable detail the basis for and calculation of) the amount or amounts, in Dollars, necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be promptly delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error (it being understood that no Lender shall be required to disclose (i) any confidential or price sensitive information or (ii) any information to the extent prohibited by applicable law). The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing
84
    
Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
(d)    Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that no Obligor shall be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank notifies the Borrower in writing of any such Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
SECTION 2.14 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor (including as a result of the occurrence of any Commitment Increase Date or an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (including in connection with any Commitment Increase Date and regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.09(g) and is revoked in accordance herewith), or (d) the assignment as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18(b) of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (excluding loss of anticipated profits). In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event (excluding, in any event, loss of anticipated profits) shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of:
(i)    the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan referred to in clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 2.14 denominated in the Currency of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such Currency for such Interest Period, over
(ii)    the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an Affiliate of such Lender) for deposits denominated in such Currency from other banks in the Eurocurrency market or, in the case of any Non-LIBOR Quoted Currency, in the relevant market for such Non-LIBOR Quoted Currency, in each case at the commencement of such period.
Payments under this Section shall be made upon written request of a Lender delivered not later than thirty (30) Business Days following the payment, conversion, or failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay that gives rise to a claim under this Section accompanied by a written
85
    
certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.15 Taxes.
(a)    Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, unless otherwise required by applicable law; provided that if any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Taxes from such payments, then (i) the Withholding Agent shall make such deductions or withholdings, (ii) the Withholding Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and (iii) if such Tax is a Covered Tax, the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) the Administrative Agent, Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings of Covered Tax been made.
(b)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c)    Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank for and, within ten (10) Business Days after written demand therefor, pay the full amount of any Covered Taxes (including Covered Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.15) payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Covered Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, by the Issuing Bank or by the Administrative Agent (on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank), shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)    Indemnification by the Lenders. To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.15(a) or (c), each Lender shall, and does hereby, agree severally to indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (i) against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) (collectively, “Tax Damages”) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly
86
    
executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding tax ineffective) and (ii) Tax Damages attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph. The agreements in this paragraph shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations.
(e)    Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.15, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. If the Borrower is required by applicable law or this Agreement to pay any U.S. federal withholding Taxes (and the Administrative Agent is not so required) and the Borrower fails to pay any such U.S. federal withholding Taxes that are Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence on account of such Excluded Taxes, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for any incremental Taxes that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender as a result of such failure, but only to the extent that such incremental Taxes exceed the amount of Excluded Taxes that would have been borne by the Administrative Agent or a Lender absent such failure.
(f)    Status of Lenders.
(i)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.15(f)(ii)(A) or (B) or Section 2.15(g) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment
87
    
such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is a U.S. Person,
(A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)    each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but, in any event, only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so) whichever of the following is applicable:
(1)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party duly completed executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or any successor form establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty,
(2)    duly completed executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or any successor form certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States,
(3)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate, signed under penalties of perjury, to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (I) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (II) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the
88
    
meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (III) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or any successor form), certifying that the Foreign Lender is not a U.S. Person, or
(4)    any other form as prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made, including, to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, duly completed executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a certificate substantially similar to the certificate described in Section 2.15(f)(ii)(B)(3)(x) above, Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable.
(C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
(g)    If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as may be necessary for the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under
89
    
FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from any such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (g), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered under this Agreement expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(h)    Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Covered Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Covered Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund ), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank in a less favorable net position after-Taxes than the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (h) shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank to make available its Tax returns or its books or records (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
(i)    Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.15 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or replacement of, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.
(j)    Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.15, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.

SECTION 2.16 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment: Sharing of Set-offs.
(a)    Payments by the Borrower. The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise expressly provided therein) prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off, deduction or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
All amounts owing under this Agreement (including commitment fees, payments required under Sections 2.13 and 2.14 (except to the extent otherwise provided therein relating to any Loan denominated in Dollars, but not including principal of, and interest on, any Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.14 or any reimbursement or cash collateralization of any LC Exposure denominated in any Foreign Currency, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan or LC Disbursement when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan or such LC Disbursement shall, if such Loan or such LC Disbursement is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or LC Disbursement that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand.
(b)    Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees of a Class then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then
91
    
due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due to such parties.
(c)    Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Borrowing of a Class shall be made from the Lenders of such Class, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under Section 2.07, 2.09 or otherwise shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders of such Class, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; (ii) each Borrowing of a Class shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the making of Loans) or their respective Loans of such Class that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment of commitment fees under Section 2.10 shall be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata according to the average daily unutilized amounts of their respective Commitments; (iv) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders or such Class pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans of such Class held by them; and (v) each payment of interest on Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans of such Class then due and payable to the respective Lenders; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that the Borrower wishes to make a Multicurrency Borrowing in an Agreed Foreign Currency and the Multicurrency Commitments are fully utilized, the Borrower may make a Borrowing under the Dollar Commitments (if otherwise permitted hereunder) and may use the proceeds of such Borrowing to prepay the Multicurrency Loans (without making a ratable prepayment to the Dollar Loans) solely to the extent that the Borrower substantially concurrently therewith utilizes any Multicurrency Commitments made available as a result of such prepayment to make a Multicurrency Borrowing in an Agreed Foreign Currency.
(d)    Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender of a Class shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans, or participations in LC Disbursements of a Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, and accrued interest thereon of such Class then due than the proportion received by any other Lender of such Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders of such Class to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of such Class; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof
92
    
(as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(e)    Presumptions of Payment. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
(f)    Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent. If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(e), 2.05 or 2.16(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.17 Defaulting Lenders.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)    commitment fees pursuant to Section 2.10(a) shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender to the extent, and during the period in which, such Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such commitment fee that otherwise would have accrued and been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender to the extent and during the period in which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender);
(b)    the Commitment and Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders, two-thirds of the Lenders, two-thirds of the Lenders of a Class, the Required Lenders or the Required Lenders of a Class have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02, except for any amendment or waiver described in Section 9.02(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)); provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders, two-thirds of the Lenders or each affected Lender which
93
    
affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other Lenders or affected Lenders (as applicable) shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
(c)    if any LC Exposure exists at the time a Multicurrency Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i)    all or any part of such LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Multicurrency Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Multicurrency Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Multicurrency Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Multicurrency Commitments, (y) no non-Defaulting Lender’s Multicurrency Credit Exposure will exceed such Lender’s Multicurrency Commitment, and (z) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time (and unless the Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time);
(ii)    if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, within three Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.04(k) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii)    if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.10(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv)    if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.10(a) and Section 2.10(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Multicurrency Lenders’ Applicable Multicurrency Percentages in effect after giving effect to such reallocation;
(v)    if any Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.17(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.10(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and
94
    
(vi)    subject to Section 9.16, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.
(d)    so long as any Multicurrency Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Multicurrency Commitments of the non-Defaulting Multicurrency Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.17(c), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.17(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).
In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower agree in writing that a Defaulting Lender that is a Dollar Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then, on the date of such agreement, such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans made to each Borrower of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for the Lenders to hold such Loans in accordance with their applicableApplicable Dollar Percentage in effect immediately after giving effect to such agreement. In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Issuing Bank each agrees in writing that a Defaulting Lender that is a Multicurrency Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then, on the date of such agreement, such Lender shall no longer be deemed a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall no longer be required to cash collateralize any portion of such Lender’s LC Exposure cash collateralized pursuant to Section 2.17(c)(ii) above, the LC Exposure of the Multicurrency Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Multicurrency Commitment and such Lender shall purchase at par the portion of the Loans of the other Multicurrency Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Multicurrency Percentage in effect immediately after giving effect to such agreement.
SECTION 2.18 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a)    Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender exercises its rights under Section 2.12(b) or requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Covered Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if in the sole reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the circumstance giving rise to such Lender exercising its rights under Section 2.12(b) and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any cost or expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay
95
    
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)    Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender exercises its rights under Section 2.12(b) or requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Covered Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.18(a), or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
(c)    Defaulting Lenders. If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(e), 2.05 or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
SECTION 2.19 Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all related Charges, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate. To the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of a Loan made to the Borrower, but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section, shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender by the Borrower in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the
96
    
Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

SECTION 3.06 Compliance with Laws and Agreements.
Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

113
    
acting on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, their respective directors, officers, employees and agents with any applicable Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions.

(ii)    The Borrower acknowledges that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have agreed to exclude each Structured Subsidiary, each SBIC Subsidiary, each CFC, each Transparent Subsidiary and each Immaterial Subsidiary as an Obligor only for so long as such Person qualifies as a “Structured Subsidiary”, “SBIC Subsidiary”, “CFC”, “Transparent Subsidiary” or “Immaterial Subsidiary”, respectively, pursuant to the definition thereof, and thereafter such Person shall no longer constitute a “Structured Subsidiary”, “SBIC Subsidiary”, “CFC”, “Transparent Subsidiary” or “Immaterial Subsidiary”, as applicable, for any purpose of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
114
    
(b)    Ownership of Subsidiaries. The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, take such action from time to time as shall be necessary to ensure that each of its Subsidiaries is a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any transaction permitted under Section 6.03 or 6.04, so long as after giving effect to such permitted transaction each of the remaining Subsidiaries is a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary.
(c)    Further Assurances. The Borrower will, and will cause each of the Subsidiary Guarantors to, take such action from time to time as shall reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent to effectuate the purposes and objectives of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower will, and will cause each of the Subsidiary Guarantors, to:
(i)    take such action from time to time (including filing appropriate Uniform Commercial Code financing statements and executing and delivering such assignments, security agreements and other instruments) as shall be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to create, in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Lenders (and any affiliate thereof that is a party to any Hedging Agreement entered into with the Borrower) and the holders of any Secured Longer-Term Indebtedness, perfected first-priority security interests and Liens in the Collateral; provided that any such security interest or Lien shall be subject to the relevant requirements of the Security Documents;
(ii)    with respect to each deposit account or securities account of the Obligors (other than (A) any such account that is maintained by the Borrower in its capacity as “servicer” for a Financing Subsidiary or any Agency Account, (B) any such accounts which hold solely money or financial assets of a Financing Subsidiary, (C) any payroll account so long as such payroll account is coded as such, (D) withholding tax and fiduciary accounts or any trust account maintained solely on behalf of a Portfolio Investment, (E) any checking account of the Obligors in which the aggregate value of deposits therein, together with all other such accounts under this clause (E), does not at any time exceed $1,000,000, provided that the Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiary Guarantors to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain control agreements governing any such account in this clause (E), and (F) any account in which the aggregate value of deposits therein, together with all other such accounts under this clause (F), does not at any time exceed $75,000; provided that in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (A) through (F), no other Person (other than the depository institution at which such account is maintained) shall have “control” (within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code) over such account, cause each bank or securities intermediary (within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code)) to enter into such arrangements with the Collateral Agent as shall be appropriate in order that the Collateral Agent has “control” (within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code) over each such deposit account or securities account (each, a “Control Account”) and in that connection, the Borrower agrees, subject to Sections 5.08(c)(iv) and (v) below, to cause all cash and other proceeds of Portfolio Investments received by any Obligor to be immediately deposited into a Control Account (or otherwise delivered to, or registered in the name of, the Collateral Agent) and, both prior to and following such deposit, delivery or registration such cash and other proceeds shall be held in trust by the Borrower for the
115
    
benefit and as the property of the Collateral Agent and shall not be commingled with any other funds or property of such Obligor or any other Person (including with any money or financial assets of the Borrower in its capacity as “servicer” for a Structured Subsidiary, or any money or financial assets of a Structured Subsidiary, or any money or financial assets of the Borrower in its capacity as an “agent” or “administrative agent” for any other Bank Loans subject to Section 5.08(c)(v) below);
(iii)    cause the Financing Subsidiaries to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such certificates and agreements, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as it shall determine are necessary to confirm that such Financing Subsidiary qualifies or continues to qualify as a “Structured Subsidiary” or an “SBIC Subsidiary”, as applicable, pursuant to the definitions thereof;
(iv)    in the case of any Portfolio Investment consisting of a Bank Loan that does not constitute all of the credit extended to the underlying borrower under the relevant underlying loan documents and a Financing Subsidiary holds any interest in the loans or other extensions of credit under such loan documents, (x) cause such Financing Subsidiary to be party to such underlying loan documents as a “lender” having a direct interest (or a participation interest not acquired from such Borrower or other Obligor) in such underlying loan documents and extensions of credit thereunder; and (y) ensure that, subject to Section 5.08(c)(v) below, all amounts owing to any Obligor by the underlying borrower or other obligated party are remitted by the borrower or obligated party (or the applicable administrative agents, collateral agents or equivalent Person) directly to the Custodian Account and no other amounts owing by such underlying borrower or obligated party are remitted to the Custodian Account;
(v)    in the event that any Obligor is acting as an agent or administrative agent under any loan documents with respect to any Bank Loan (or is acting in an analogous agency capacity under any agreement related to any Portfolio Investment) and such Obligor does not hold all of the credit extended to the underlying borrower or issuer under the relevant underlying loan documents or other agreements, ensure that (1) all funds held by such Obligor in such capacity as agent or administrative agent are segregated from all other funds of such Obligor and clearly identified as being held in an agency capacity (an “Agency Account”); (2) all amounts owing on account of such Bank Loan or Portfolio Investment by the underlying borrower or other obligated party are remitted by such borrower or obligated party to either (A) such Agency Account or (B) directly to an account in the name of the underlying lender to whom such amounts are owed (for the avoidance of doubt, no funds representing amounts owing to more than one underlying lender may be remitted to any single account other than the Agency Account); and (3) within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such funds, such Obligor acting in its capacity as agent or administrative agent shall distribute any such funds belonging to any Obligor to the Custodian Account (provided that if any distribution referred to in this clause (v) is not permitted by applicable bankruptcy law to be made within such two (2) Business Day period as a result of the bankruptcy of the underlying borrower, such Obligor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission to make such distribution and shall make such distribution as soon as legally permitted to do so); and
116
    
(vi)    in the case of any Portfolio Investment held by any Financing Subsidiary, including any cash collection related thereto, ensure that such Portfolio Investment shall not be held in any Custodian Account, or any other account of any Obligor.
SECTION 5.09 Use of Proceeds. The Borrower will use the proceeds of the Loans and the issuances of Letters of Credit only for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, including making distributions not prohibited by this Agreement and the acquisition and funding (either directly or indirectly as permitted hereunder) of leveraged loans, mezzanine loans, high-yield securities, convertible securities, preferred stock, common stock and other Investments in each case to the extent otherwise permitted hereunder; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any responsibility as to the use of any of such proceeds. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used in violation of applicable law, rule or regulation or, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying any Margin Stock. On the Effective Date, the first day (if any) an Obligor acquires any Margin Stock and at any other time requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U-1, as applicable, referred to in Regulation U. Margin Stock shall be purchased by the Obligors only with the proceeds of Indebtedness not directly or indirectly secured by Margin Stock (within the meaning of Regulation U), or with the proceeds of equity capital of the Borrower. No Obligor will (and each Obligor will procure that its Subsidiaries and its or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall not) directly or indirectly use the proceeds of the Loans or otherwise make available such proceeds (I) to any Person for the purpose of financing the activities or business of or with any Person, or in any country or territory, that, at the time of such funding, is, or whose government is, the subject of any Sanctions or in any other manner that would result in a violation of Sanctions by any Person or (II) in violation of Anti-Corruption Laws or for any payments to any governmental official or employee, political party, official of a political party, candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of any Anti-Corruption Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, Letters of Credit may be issued to support obligations of any Portfolio Company; provided that the underlying obligations of such Portfolio Company to the applicable Obligors in respect of such Letters of Credit shall not be included in the Borrowing Base.
SECTION 5.10 Status of RIC and BDC. The Borrower shall at all times maintain its status as a “business development company” under the Investment Company Act and as a RIC under the Code.
SECTION 5.11 Investment Policies; Valuation Policy. The Borrower shall at all times be in compliance in all material respects with its Investment Policies and its Valuation Policy, in each case as amended by Permitted Policy Amendments.
SECTION 5.12 Portfolio Valuation and Diversification Etc.  (i) Industry Classification Groups. For purposes of this Agreement, the Borrower shall assign each Eligible Portfolio Investment to an Industry Classification Group as reasonably determined by the Borrower. To the extent that the Borrower reasonably determines that any Eligible Portfolio
117
    
Investment is not correlated with the risks of other Eligible Portfolio Investments in an Industry Classification Group, such Eligible Portfolio Investment may be assigned by the Borrower to an Industry Classification Group that is more closely correlated to such Eligible Portfolio Investment. In the absence of adequate correlation, the Borrower shall be permitted to, upon notice to the Administrative Agent for distribution to each Lender, create up to three additional industry classification groups for purposes of this Agreement; provided that no more than three different additional industry classification groups may be created pursuant to this paragraph (a).
(b)    Portfolio Valuation Etc.
(i)    Settlement-Date Basis. For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, all determinations of whether a Portfolio Investment is an Eligible Portfolio Investment shall be determined on a Settlement-Date Basis, provided that no such investment shall be included as an Eligible Portfolio Investment to the extent it has not been paid for in full.
(ii)    Determination of Values. The Borrower will conduct reviews of the value to be assigned to each of its Eligible Portfolio Investments as follows:
(A)    Quoted Investments External Review. With respect to Eligible Portfolio Investments (including Cash Equivalents) traded in an active and orderly market for which market quotations are readily available (“Quoted Investments”), the Borrower shall, not less frequently than once each calendar week, determine the market value of such Quoted Investments which shall, in each case, be determined in accordance with one of the following methodologies as selected by the Borrower (each such value, an “External Quoted Value”):
(w)    in the case of public and 144A securities, the average of the most recent bid prices as determined by two Approved Dealers selected by the Borrower,
(x)    in the case of Bank Loans, the average of the most recent bid prices as determined by two Approved Dealers selected by the Borrower or an Approved Pricing Service which makes reference to at least two Approved Dealers with respect to such Bank Loans,
(y)    in the case of any Quoted Investment traded on an exchange, the closing price for such Eligible Portfolio Investment most recently posted on such exchange,
(z)    in the case of any other Quoted Investment, the fair market value thereof as determined by an Approved Pricing Service; and
(B)    Unquoted Investments External Review. With respect to all Portfolio Investments owned by an Obligor for which market quotations are not readily available (“Unquoted Investments”), the Borrower shall value such Unquoted Investments in a manner consistent with its Valuation Policy, but in any
118
    
event including the valuation of at least 35% of the Value (to be determined as of the last available Borrowing Base Certificate) of all Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base by an Approved Third-Party Appraiser which shall assist the Directing Body of the Borrower in determining the fair market value of such Unquoted Investments, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (values determined in accordance with this sub-clause (B) are referred to as “Borrower External Unquoted Values”), such assistance each quarter to include providing the Directing Body of the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) with a written independent valuation report. Each such valuation report shall also include the information required to comply with paragraph (16) of Schedule 1.01(c).
(C)    Internal Review. The Borrower shall conduct internal reviews to determine the value of all Eligible Portfolio Investments in accordance with its Valuation Policy at least once each calendar quarter, and shall conduct internal reviews with respect to the Eligible Portfolio Investments at least once each calendar week for the purpose of reviewing and discussing the Borrower’s asset portfolio (which shall take into account any events of which the Borrower has knowledge that adversely affect the value of any Eligible Portfolio Investment (other than in an immaterial manner)) (each such value established pursuant to this clause (C), an “Internal Value”).
(D)    Failure of Borrower to Determine Values. If the Borrower shall fail to determine the value of any Portfolio Investment as at any date pursuant to the requirements (but subject to the exclusions) of the foregoing sub-clauses (A), (B) or (C) then the “Value” of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of the Borrowing Base as at such date shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of the Borrowing Base.
(E)    Value of Quoted Investments. Subject to Section 5.12(b)(iii), the “Value” of each Quoted Investment for all purposes of this Agreement shall be the lowest of (1) the Internal Value of such Quoted Investment as most recently determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C), (2) the External Quoted Value of such Quoted Investment as most recently determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A) and (3) if such Quoted Investment is a debt investment, the par or face value of such Quoted Investment.
(F)    Value of Unquoted Investments. Subject to Section 5.12(b)(iii),
(x)    if the Internal Value of any Unquoted Investment as most recently determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) falls below, or within the range of (as applicable), the Applicable External Value of such Unquoted Investment as most recently determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B), then the “Value” of such Unquoted Investment for all purposes of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the lower of (i) the Internal Value and (ii) if such Unquoted
119
    
Investment is a debt investment, the par or face value of such Unquoted Investment; and
(y)    if the Internal Value of any Unquoted Investment as most recently determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) falls above the Applicable External Value (or, as applicable, the range thereof) of such Unquoted Investment as most recently determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) (and the Applicable External Value of such Unquoted Investment is such Borrower External Unquoted Value), then the “Value” of such Unquoted Investment for all purposes of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the lower of (i) the midpoint of the range of the Borrower External Unquoted Value and (ii) if such Unquoted Investment is a debt investment, the par or face value of such Unquoted Investment.
except that if an Unquoted Investment is acquired during a fiscal quarter, the “Value” of such Unquoted Investment shall be deemed to be equal to the lowest of (i) the Internal Value of such Unquoted Investment as determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C), (ii) the cost of such Unquoted Investment; and (iii) if such Unquoted Investment is a debt investment, the par or face value of such Unquoted Investment, until such time as the Borrower External Unquoted Value of such Unquoted Investment is determined (or required to be determined) in accordance with Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) .
(G)    Actions Upon a Borrowing Base Deficiency. If, based upon such weekly internal review, the Borrower determines that a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, then the Borrower shall, promptly and in any event within two Business Days as provided in Section 5.01(e), deliver a Borrowing Base Certificate reflecting the new amount of the Borrowing Base and shall take the actions, and make prepayments (and, to the extent necessary, provide cover for Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.04(k)), but only to the extent required by Section 2.09(b).
(H)    Initial Value of Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from the Effective Date until the date when the valuation reports are required to be delivered under Section 5.01(h) for the quarter ending March 31, 2019, the Value of any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base shall be the Value as determined in a manner consistent with this Section 5.12 and, with respect to assets acquired before the Effective Date, as delivered to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Effective Date.
(iii)    Testing of Values
(A)    Each February 28, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each calendar year, commencing on April 30, 2019 (or such other dates as are agreed to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, but in no event less frequently than once per calendar quarter, each a “Valuation Testing Date”), the
120
    
Administrative Agent through an Independent Valuation Provider will value those Portfolio Investments selected by the Administrative Agent and communicated in writing to the Borrower at least ten (10) days prior to the applicable Valuation Testing Date (and which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include Portfolio Investments other than Unquoted Investments) (values assigned pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(iii)(A), together with values assigned by an Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(iii)(C) below, the “Agent External Values”); provided that the assets that the Administrative Agent will have the right to value under this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A) will not exceed assets with a Value approximately equal to the Calculation Amount (as defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, Unquoted Investments that are part of the Collateral but not included in the Borrowing Base as of a Valuation Testing Date shall not be subject to testing under this Section 5.12(b)(iii); provided that such Unquoted Investment shall continue to be excluded from the Borrowing Base until such time as the Borrower determines (subject to the other terms and conditions contained herein) to include it in the Borrowing Base.
(B)    For purposes of this Agreement, the “Calculation Amount” shall be equal to the greater of (a)(i) 125% of the Adjusted Covered Debt Balance (to be determined as of the last available Borrowing Base Certificate) minus (ii) the sum of the Values of all Quoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base (the determination of fair value for such percentage thresholds to be based off of the last determination of value of the Portfolio Investments pursuant to this Section 5.12) and (b) 10% of the aggregate Value (or as near thereto as reasonably practicable) of all Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base (to be determined as of the last available Borrowing Base Certificate); provided that in no event shall more than 25% (or, if clause (b) applies, 10% or as near thereto as reasonably practicable) of the aggregate Value of the Unquoted Investments in the Borrowing Base (to be determined as of the last available Borrowing Base Certificate) be tested by the Independent Valuation Provider on any Valuation Testing Date.
(C)    Supplemental Testing of Values: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, individually or at the request of the Required Lenders, shall at any time have the right, solely for purposes of the Borrowing Base, to request in its reasonable discretion any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base with a value assigned by the Borrower (other than Portfolio Investments with Agent External Values as of the most recent Valuation Testing Date) to be independently valued by an Independent Valuation Provider for purposes of the Borrowing Base. There shall be no limit on the number of such appraisals requested by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion and, subject to Section 5.12(b)(iv)(C) below, the costs of any such valuation shall be at the expense of the Borrower.
(D)    Value Dispute Resolution: If the difference in the Value of any Portfolio Investment determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)
121
    
and any Agent External Value is (1) less than or equal to 5% of the Value thereof, then the Borrower’s Value shall be used, (2) greater than 5% and less than or equal to 20% of the Value thereof, then the Value of such Portfolio Investment shall be the average of the Value determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) and the Agent External Value and (3) greater than 20% of the Value thereof, then either (i) the Value shall be the lesser of the two Values or (ii) if the Borrower so elects, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall retain (at the Borrower’s sole cost and expense) an additional Approved Third-Party Appraiser and the Value of such Portfolio Investment shall be the average of the three valuations (with the lesser of the Agent External Value and the value determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) to be used until the third Value is obtained). For purposes of this Section 5.12(b)(iii)(C), if the Agent External Value is a range, then the Value shall be deemed the midpoint of the range.
(E)    Failure of Administrative Agent to Determine Values. If the Administrative Agent shall fail to determine the value, at any date pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(iii), of any Eligible Portfolio Investment identified to the Borrower in advance of such date as a result of any action, inaction or lack of cooperation of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, then the “Value” of such Eligible Portfolio Investment shall be deemed to be zero. If the Administrative Agent shall fail to determine the value, at any date pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(iii), of any Eligible Portfolio Investment identified to the Borrower in advance of such date for any other reason, then the Value of such Eligible Portfolio Investment shall be the lower of the Internal Value and, if such Unquoted Investment is a debt investment, the par or face value of such Eligible Portfolio Investment; provided, however that if a Borrower Eternal Unquoted Value has been obtained with respect to such asset for the quarterly period immediately preceding the current quarterly period, then the “Value” of such Eligible Portfolio will be determined as provided in Section 5.2(b)(ii)(F) above.
(iv)    Generally Applicable Valuation Provisions
(A)    The Value of any Portfolio Investment for which the Independent Valuation Provider’s value is used shall be the midpoint of the range (if any) determined by the Independent Valuation Provider. The Independent Valuation Provider shall apply a recognized valuation methodology that is commonly accepted in the Borrower’s industry for valuing Portfolio Investments of the type being valued and held by the Obligors. Other procedures relating to the valuation will be reasonably agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.
(B)    All valuations shall be on a Settlement-Date Basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the value of any Portfolio Investments determined in accordance with any provision of this Section 5.12 shall be the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement until a new Value for such
122
    
Portfolio Investment is subsequently determined in good faith in accordance with this Section 5.12.
(C)    Subject to the last sentence of Section 9.03(a), the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of any valuation reasonably incurred by the Administrative Agent under this Section 5.12 shall be at the expense of the Borrower; provided that the Borrower’s obligation to reimburse valuation costs incurred by the Administrative Agent under Section 5.12(b)(iii)(C) shall under no circumstances be in excess of the IVP Supplemental Cap.
(D)    The values determined by the Independent Valuation Provider shall be deemed to be “Information” hereunder and subject to Section 9.13 hereof.
(E)    The Administrative Agent shall provide a copy of the final results of any valuation received by the Administrative Agent and performed by the Independent Valuation Provider or an Approved Third-Party Appraiser to any Lender within ten (10) Business Days after such Lender’s request, except to the extent that such recipient has not executed and delivered a non-reliance letter, confidentiality agreement or similar agreement requested or required by such Independent Valuation Provider or Approved Third-Party Appraiser, as applicable.
(F)    The foregoing valuation procedures shall only be required to be used for purposes of calculating the Borrowing Base and related concepts and shall not be required to be utilized by the Borrower for any other purpose, including, without limitation, the delivery of financial statements or valuations required under ASC820 or the Investment Company Act.
(G)    The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of its receipt of the written final results of any such test within ten (10) Business Days after its receipt thereof and shall provide a copy of such results and the related report to the Borrower within ten (10) Business Days after the Borrower’s request.
(c)    Investment Company Diversification Requirements. The Borrower (together with its Subsidiaries to the extent required by the Investment Company Act) will at all times comply in all material respects with the portfolio diversification and similar requirements set forth in the Investment Company Act applicable to business development companies. The Borrower will at all times, subject to applicable grace periods set forth in the Code, comply with the portfolio diversification and similar requirements set forth in the Code applicable to RICs.
SECTION 5.13 Calculation of Borrowing Base. For purposes of this Agreement, the “Borrowing Base” shall be determined, as at any date of determination, as the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (x) the Value of each Eligible Portfolio Investment (excluding any cash held by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(k)) by (y) the applicable Advance Rate; provided that:
123
    
(a)    the Advance Rate applicable to the aggregate Value of all Eligible Portfolio Investments in their entirety shall be 0% at any time when the Borrowing Base is composed entirely of Eligible Portfolio Investments issued by fewer than 20 different issuers;
(b)    the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Eligible Portfolio Investments issued by all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding (i) 5% of the aggregate Value of all Eligible Portfolio Investments included in the Borrowing Base (for the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of fair value for purposes of this subclause shall be made without taking into account any Advance Rate) (the “Total Eligible Portfolio”), shall be 50% of the otherwise applicable Advance Rate and (ii) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate fair value of Eligible Portfolio Investments of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 7.5% of the Total Eligible Portfolio of the Total Eligible Portfolio shall be 0%; provided that at any time the Consolidated Asset Coverage Ratio is less than 175%, the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate fair value of Eligible Portfolio Investments of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities in accordance with GAAP exceeding 5% of the Total Eligible Portfolio shall be 0%;
(c)    the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the Total Eligible Portfolio issued by Portfolio Companies in the same Industry Classification Group that exceeds (x) 20% of the Total Eligible Portfolio for each of the Two Largest Industry Classification Groups, and (y) 15% of the Total Eligible Portfolio for any other industry sector, shall be 0%;
(d)    the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of Portfolio Investments that are not Cash, Cash Equivalents, Long-Term U.S. Government Securities or Performing First Lien Bank Loans that exceeds 30% of the Total Eligible Portfolio shall be 0%;
(e)    the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of Portfolio Investments that are Performing Mezzanine Investments, Performing High Yield Securities, Performing PIK Obligations and Performing DIP Loans that exceeds 20% of the Total Eligible Portfolio shall be 0%;
(f)    the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of Portfolio Investments that are Performing PIK Obligations that exceeds 5% of the Total Eligible Portfolio shall be 0%;
(g)    the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of Portfolio Investments that are Performing DIP Loans that exceeds 10% of the Total Eligible Portfolio shall be 0%;
(h)    the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of Portfolio Investments that are Performing Covenant-Lite Loans (excluding, for clarity, Broadly Syndicated Loans) that exceeds 10% of the Total Eligible Portfolio shall be 0%; and
124
    
(i)    the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of Portfolio Investments that are investments in Permitted Foreign Jurisdiction Portfolio Investments that exceeds 20% of the Total Eligible Portfolio Investments shall be 0%.
For all purposes of this Section 5.13, (A) all issuers of Eligible Portfolio Investments that are Affiliates of one another shall be treated as a single issuer (unless such issuers are Affiliates of one another solely because they are under the common Control of the same private equity sponsor or similar sponsor) and (B) to the extent the Total Eligible Portfolio is required to be reduced to comply with this Section 5.13, the Borrower shall be permitted to choose the Eligible Portfolio Investments to be so removed to effect such reduction. For the avoidance of doubt, no Portfolio Investment shall be an Eligible Portfolio Investment unless, among the other requirements set forth in this Agreement, (i) such Investment is subject only to Eligible Liens, (ii) such Investment is Transferable and (iii) such Investment meets all of the other criteria set forth on Schedule 1.01(c) hereto. In addition, as used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:
“Advance Rate” means, as to any Eligible Portfolio Investment and subject to adjustment as provided above, the following percentages with respect to such Eligible Portfolio Investment:
Eligible Portfolio Investment	Unquoted	Quoted
Cash and Cash Equivalents (including Short-Term U.S. Government Securities)	n/a	100%

provided, that at any time the Consolidated Asset Coverage Ratio is less than 167% (as reported in the most recently delivered monthly Borrowing Base Certificate pursuant to Section 5.01(d)), every Advance Rate in the table above that is below the line for “Performing First Lien Middle Market Loans” shall be five percentage points less than the applicable rate indicated in the table.

For the avoidance of doubt, the categories above are intended to be indicative of the traditional investment types. All determinations of whether a particular Portfolio Investment belongs to one category or another shall be made by the Borrower on a consistent basis with the foregoing. For example, a secured bank loan solely at a holding company, the only assets of which are the shares of an operating company, may constitute Mezzanine Investments, but would not ordinarily constitute a First Lien Bank Loan.
“Bank Loans” means debt obligations (including, without limitation, term loans, revolving loans, debtor-in-possession financings, the funded portion of revolving credit lines and letter of credit facilities and other similar loans and investments including interim loans, bridge loans and second lien loans) that are generally provided under a syndicated loan or credit facility or pursuant to any loan agreement or other similar credit facility, whether or not syndicated.

“Defaulted Obligation” means any Investment in Indebtedness (a) as to which, (x) a default as to the payment of principal and/or interest has occurred and is continuing for a period of thirty two (32) consecutive days with respect to such Indebtedness (without regard to any grace period applicable thereto, or waiver thereof) or (y) a default not set forth in clause (x) has occurred and the holders of such Indebtedness have accelerated all or a portion of the principal amount thereof as a result of such default; (b) as to which a default as to the payment of principal and/or interest has occurred and is continuing on another material debt obligation of the Portfolio Company under such Indebtedness which is senior or pari passu in right of payment to such Indebtedness; (c) as to which the Portfolio Company under such Indebtedness or others have instituted proceedings to have such Portfolio Company adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent or placed into receivership and such proceedings have not been stayed or dismissed or such Portfolio Company has filed for protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any similar foreign proceeding (unless, in the case of clause (b) or (c), such Indebtedness is a DIP Loan, in which case it shall not be deemed to be a Defaulted Obligation under such clause); (d) as to which a default rate of interest has been and continues to be charged for more than 120 consecutive days, or foreclosure on collateral for such Indebtedness has been commenced and is being pursued by or on behalf of the holders thereof; or (e) as to which the Borrower has

Section 364; (b) the Debtor’s bankruptcy case is still pending as a case under the provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and has not been dismissed or converted to a case under the provisions of Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; (c) the Debtor’s obligations under such loan have not been (i) disallowed, in whole or in part, or (ii) subordinated, in whole or in part, to the claims or interests of any other Person under the provisions of 11 U.S.C. Section 510; (d) the DIP Loan is secured and the Liens granted by the applicable bankruptcy court or federal district court in relation to the Loan have not been subordinated or junior to, or pari passu with, in whole or in part, to the Liens of any other lender under the provisions of 11 U.S.C.

For the purposes of this definition, an order is a “final order” if the applicable period for filing a motion to reconsider or notice of appeal in respect of a permanent order authorizing the Debtor to obtain credit has lapsed and no such motion or notice has been filed with the applicable bankruptcy court or federal district court or the clerk thereof.
“EBITDA” means the consolidated net income of the applicable Person (excluding extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring gains and extraordinary losses (to the extent excluded in the definition of “EBITDA”, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted consolidated EBITDA or such similar term as may be used in the applicable documentation) in the relevant agreement relating to the applicable Eligible Portfolio Investment) for the relevant period plus, without duplication, the following to the extent deducted in calculating such consolidated net income in the relevant agreement relating to the applicable Eligible Portfolio Investment for such period: (i) consolidated interest charges for such period, (ii) the provision for Federal, state, local and foreign income taxes payable for such period, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense for such period, and (iv) such other adjustments included in the definition of “EBITDA” (or similar defined term used for the purposes contemplated herein) in the relevant agreement relating to the applicable Eligible Portfolio Investment, provided that such adjustments are usual and customary
127
    
and substantially comparable to market terms for substantially similar debt of other similarly situated borrowers at the time such relevant agreements are entered into as reasonably determined in good faith by the Borrower.

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall a First Lien Bank Loan include a Last Out Loan.
“High Yield Securities” means debt Securities, in each case (a) issued by public or private issuers, (b) issued pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereunder) and (c) that are not Cash Equivalents, Mezzanine Investments (described under clause (i) of the definition thereof) or Bank Loans.
“Last Out Loan” means, with respect to any loan that would otherwise qualify as a First Lien Bank Loan but is a term loan structured in a first out tranche and a last out tranche (with the first out tranche entitled to a lower interest rate but priority with respect to payments), that portion of such Bank Loan that is the last out tranche; provided that:
(a) such last out tranche is entitled (along with the first out tranche) to the benefit of a first lien and first priority perfected security interest on all or substantially all of the assets of the respective borrower and guarantors obligated in respect thereof (subject to customary exceptions), and which has the most senior pre-petition priority in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceedings (taking into account the payment priority of the first out tranche and subject to customary permitted liens as contemplated by the applicable credit facility documents);
(b) the ratio of (x) the amount of the first out tranche to (y) EBITDA of the underlying obligor does not at any time exceed 2.25 to 1.00;

(d) such first out tranche is not subject to multiple drawings (unless, at the time of such drawing and after giving effect thereto, the ratio referenced in clause (b) above is not exceeded).
For clarity, any last out loan that complies with subsection (a) above, but fails to qualify under any of (b), (c) and/or (d) above, will have the advance rates of a Second Lien Bank Loan (to the extent it otherwise meets the definition of Second Lien Bank Loan) applied to such Loan.

payment rights or lien priorities that are junior or senior to the rights of such Obligor, such Portfolio Investment may be subject to customary and market based rights of first refusal, rights of first offer and purchase rights in favor, in each case, of such other lenders thereof (so long as the Value used in determining the Borrowing Base is not greater than the amount of such right of first refusal, first offer or purchase rights).

(p)    except for expiration or termination in accordance with its terms, any of the Security Documents shall for whatever reason be terminated or cease to be in full force and effect in any material respect, or the enforceability thereof shall be contested by any Obligor, or there shall be any actual invalidity of any guaranty thereunder or any Obligor or any Affiliate of an Obligor shall so assert in writing;

THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
SECTION 8.01 Appointment.
(a)    Appointment of the Administrative Agent. Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
(b)    Appointment of the Collateral Agent. Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent as its collateral agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Collateral Agent to have all the rights and benefits hereunder and thereunder (including Section 9 of the Guarantee and Security Agreement), and to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. In addition to the rights, privileges and immunities in the Guarantee and Security Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to all rights, privileges, immunities, exculpations and indemnities of the Administrative Agent for such purpose and each reference to the Administrative Agent in this Article VIII shall be deemed to include the Collateral Agent.
SECTION 8.02 Capacity as Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any other Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to, make investments in and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to the other Lenders.
SECTION 8.03 Limitation of Duties; Exculpation. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
148
    
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Loan Documents or the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Administrative Agent be liable or responsible in any way or manner for the failure to obtain or receive an Agent External Value for any asset or for the failure to send any notice required under Section 5.12(b)(iii)(A).
SECTION 8.04 Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
SECTION 8.05 Sub-Agents. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
SECTION 8.06 Resignation; Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld (provided that no such consent shall be
149
    
required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which is not a Disqualified Lender. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation shall nonetheless become effective except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
SECTION 8.07 Reliance by Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
SECTION 8.08 Modifications to Loan Documents. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02(b) or 9.02(c) with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Loan Documents; provided that, without the prior consent of each Lender, the Administrative Agent shall not (except as provided herein or in the Security Documents) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under any Security Document providing for collateral security, agree to additional obligations being secured by all or substantially all of such collateral security, or alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the benefits of the Liens created under the Security Documents with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral, except that no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, to release any Lien covering property that is the subject of either (x) a disposition of property permitted hereunder (which release described in this clause (x) shall be automatic and
150
    
require no further action from any party) or (y) a disposition to which the Required Lenders have consented.
SECTION 8.09 Certain ERISA Matters.
(a)    Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, each Joint Lead Arranger, and their respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Obligor, that at least one of the following is and will be true:
(i)    such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments or this Agreement;
(ii)    the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to, and covers, such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement;
(iii)    (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement; or
(iv)    such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Lender.
(b)    In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender
151
    
party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and each Joint Lead Arranger and their respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Obligor, that none of the Administrative Agent or any Joint Lead Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates is a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).
SECTION 8.10 Agents. None of the Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent or any Lead Arranger shall have obligations or duties whatsoever in such capacity under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and shall incur no liability hereunder or thereunder in such capacity, but all such persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder.
SECTION 8.11 Collateral Matters. (i) Except with respect to the exercise of setoff rights in accordance with Section 9.08 or with respect to a Secured Party’s right to file a proof of claim in an insolvency proceeding, no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce any Guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligations (as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement), it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms thereof.
(b)    In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, no arrangements in respect of any Hedging Agreement the obligations under which constitute Hedging Agreement Obligations, will create (or be deemed to create) in favor of any Secured Party that is a party thereto any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Obligor under any Loan Document. By accepting the benefits of the Collateral, each Secured Party that is a party to any such arrangement in respect of Hedging Agreements shall be deemed to have appointed the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent, respectively, under the Loan Documents and agreed to be bound by the Loan Documents as a Secured Party thereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph.
(c)    Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative Agent’s or the Collateral Agent’s Lien thereon or any certificate prepared by any Obligor in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
152
    
SECTION 8.12 Credit Bidding. The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Secured Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which an Obligor is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Collateral Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Secured Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the Collateral Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Secured Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such purchase). In connection with any such bid, (i) the Collateral Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each of the Secured Parties’ ratable interests in the Secured Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Collateral Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Collateral Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 9.02 of this Agreement), (iv) the Collateral Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Secured Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Secured Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Secured Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Secured Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Secured Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata with their original interest in such Secured Obligations and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Secured Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Secured Obligations of each Secured Party
153
    
are deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.
SECTION 8.13     Non-Receipt of Funds by Administrative Agent; Erroneous Payments.
(a)    Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender or Borrower (either one as appropriate being the “Payor”) prior to the date on which such Lender is to make payment hereunder to Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Loan or Borrower is to make payment to Administrative Agent, as the case may be (either such payment being a “Required Payment”), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor will not make the Required Payment in full to Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made in full to Administrative Agent on such date, and Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may, but shall not be obligated to, in reliance upon such assumption, make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient on such date. If and to the extent the Payor shall not have in fact so made the Required Payment in full to Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount made available to it together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount was so made available by Administrative Agent until the date Administrative Agent recovers such amount, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, (x) with respect to Eurocurrency Borrowings, the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Loans having an Interest Period of one month’s duration and (y) with respect to Borrowings denominated in Pounds Sterling or Swiss Francs, the interest rate applicable to RFR Loans denominated in such Currency, as applicable.
(b)    (i) Each Lender hereby agrees that (x) if the Administrative Agent notifies such Lender that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Lender from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees or otherwise; individually and collectively, a “Payment”) were erroneously transmitted to such Lender (whether or not known to such Lender), and demands the return of such Payment (or a portion thereof), such Lender shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect, and (y) to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to the Administrative Agent, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Payments received,
154
    
including without limitation any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender under this Section 8.13(b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(ii)    Each Lender hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a “Payment Notice”) or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment Notice, it shall be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to such Payment.  Each Lender agrees that, in each such case, or if it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such occurrence and, upon demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect.
(iii)    The Borrower hereby agrees that (x) in the event an erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Lender that has received such Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Lender with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower, except, in each case, to the extent such erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower for the purpose of making such erroneous Payment.
(iv)    Each party’s obligations under this Section 8.13 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations of the Obligors under any Loan Document.

157
    
modified by the Administrative Agent from time to time (including, as of the Restatement Effective Date, a user ID/password authorization system) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lenders and each of the Obligors acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure, that the Administrative Agent is not responsible for approving or vetting the representatives or contacts of any Lender that are added to the Approved Electronic Platform, and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution.

(v)    Each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that Communications have been posted to the Approved Electronic Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender or Issuing Bank for purposes of the Loan Documents; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.03 if such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. Each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees (A) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (which could be in the form of electronic communication) from time to time of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s email address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by
158
    
electronic transmission and (B) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such email address.
(vi)    Each of the Lenders, Issuing Bank and Obligors agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but (except as may be required by applicable law) shall not be obligated to, store the Communications on the Approved Electronic Platform in accordance with the Administrative Agent’s generally applicable document retention policies and procedures.
(vii)    Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or Issuing Bank to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document.
(viii)    “Communications” means, collectively, any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material provided by or on behalf of any Obligor pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated therein which is distributed by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or Issuing Bank by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section, including through an Approved Electronic Platform.
SECTION 9.02 Waivers; Amendments.
(a)    No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.
(b)    Amendments to this Agreement. Except as set forth in the definition of Secured Longer-Term Indebtedness and Unsecured Longer-Term Indebtedness as in effect on the date hereof, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, subject to Section 2.17(b), no such agreement shall
(i)    increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender,
159
    
(ii)    reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby,
(iii)    postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees or other amounts payable to a Lender hereunder, or reduce the amount or waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby,
(iv)    change Section 2.16(b), (c) or (d) or Section 2.09(f) (or other sections referred to therein to the extent relating to pro rata payments) in a manner that would alter the pro rata reduction of commitments, sharing of payments, or making of disbursements, required thereby without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby,
(v)    change any of the provisions of this Section, the definition of the term “Required Lenders” (including the percentage therein) or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender,
(vi)    other than as permitted by this Agreement, the Guarantee and Security Agreement or any other applicable Loan Document, release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Lien created under the Guarantee and Security Agreement or release all or substantially all the Obligors from their obligations as Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender,
(vii)    amend the definition of “Applicable Percentage”, “Applicable Dollar Percentage” or “Applicable Multicurrency Percentage” without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, or
(viii)    permit the assignment or transfer by any Obligor of any of its rights or obligations under any Loan Document without the consent of each Lender;
provided further that (x) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and (y) the consent of Lenders holding not less than two-thirds of the total Credit Exposures and unused Commitments will be required for (A) any change adverse to the Lenders affecting the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Borrowing Base (including the definitions used therein), and (B) any release of any material portion of the Collateral other than for fair value or as otherwise permitted hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.
For purposes of this Section, the “scheduled date of payment” of any amount shall refer to the date of payment of such amount specified in this Agreement, and shall not refer to a date or other event specified for the mandatory or optional prepayment of such amount. In addition, whenever a waiver, amendment or modification requires the consent of a Lender
160
    
“affected” thereby, such waiver, amendment or modification shall, upon consent of such Lender, become effective as to such Lender whether or not it becomes effective as to any other Lender, so long as the Required Lenders consent to such waiver, amendment or modification as provided above.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Lenders of any Class in a manner that does not affect all Classes equally shall be effective against the Lenders of such Class unless the Required Lenders of such Class shall have concurred with such waiver, amendment or modification as provided above; provided, however, in no other circumstances shall the concurrence of the Required Lenders of a particular Class be required for any waiver, amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(c)    Amendments to Security Documents.  No Security Document nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified, except to the extent otherwise expressly contemplated by the Guarantee and Security Agreement, and the Liens granted under the Guarantee and Security Agreement may not be spread to secure any additional obligations (including any increase in Loans hereunder, but excluding (i) any such increase pursuant to a Commitment Increase under Section 2.07(e) and (ii) any Secured Longer-Term Indebtedness permitted hereunder) except to the extent otherwise expressly contemplated by the Guarantee and Security Agreement and except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower, and by the Collateral Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, subject to Section 2.17(b), (i) without the written consent of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the total Credit Exposures and unused Commitments, no such waiver, amendment or modification to the Guarantee and Security Agreement shall (A) release any Obligor representing more than 10% of the Stockholders’ Equity from its obligations under the Security Documents, (B) release any guarantor representing more than 10% of the Stockholders’ Equity under the Guarantee and Security Agreement from its guarantee obligations thereunder, or (C) amend the definition of “Collateral” under the Security Documents (except to add additional collateral) and (ii) without the written consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall (W) release all or substantially all of the Obligors from their respective obligations under the Security Documents, (X) release all or substantially all of the collateral security or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under the Security Documents, (Y) release all or substantially all of the guarantors under the Guarantee and Security Agreement from their guarantee obligations thereunder, or (Z) alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the Liens created under the Security Documents (except in connection with securing additional obligations equally and ratably with the Loans and other obligations hereunder) with respect to all or substantially all of the collateral security provided thereby; except that no such consent described in clause (i) or (ii) above shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized (and so agrees with the Borrower) to direct the Collateral Agent under the Guarantee and Security Agreement, to (1) release any Lien covering property (and to release any such guarantor) that is the subject of either a disposition of property permitted hereunder or a disposition to which the Required Lenders or the required number or percentage of Lenders have consented (and such Lien shall be released automatically to the extent provided in Section 10.03(c) of the Guarantee and Security Agreement), or otherwise in accordance with Section
161
    
9.15 and (2) release from the Guarantee and Security Agreement any Subsidiary Guarantor (and any property of such Subsidiary Guarantor) that is designated as a Financing Subsidiary in accordance with this Agreement or which ceases to be consolidated on the Borrower’s financial statements and is no longer required to be a “Subsidiary Guarantor”, so long as in the case of this clause (2): (A) prior to and immediately after giving effect to any such release (and any concurrent acquisitions of Portfolio Investments or payment of outstanding Loans or Other Covered Indebtedness) the Covered Debt Amount does not exceed the Borrowing Base and no Default or Event of Default exists, and the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer to such effect and (B) after giving effect to such release (and any concurrent acquisitions of Portfolio Investments or payment of outstanding Loans or Other Covered Indebtedness), either (I) the amount by which the Borrowing Base exceeds the Covered Debt Amount immediately prior to such release is not diminished as a result of such release or (II) the Borrowing Base immediately after giving effect to such release is at least 115% of the Covered Debt Amount.
(d)    Replacement of Non-Consenting Lender. If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring (i) the consent of “each Lender” or “each Lender affected thereby,” or (ii) the consent of “two-thirds of the holders of the total Credit Exposures and unused Commitments”, the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but not obtained being referred to herein as a “Non-Consenting Lender”), then the Borrower shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to replace each such Non-Consenting Lender or Lenders with one or more replacement Lenders pursuant to Section 2.18(b) so long as at the time of such replacement, each such replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination.
(e)    Ambiguity, Omission, Mistake or Typographical Error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower acting together identify any ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect in any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend, modify or supplement such provision to cure such ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect, and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.
SECTION 9.03 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
(a)    Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and their Affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one outside counsel and of any necessary special and/or local counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent collectively (other than the allocated costs of internal counsel)), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration (other than internal overhead charges) of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) including all costs and expenses of the Independent Valuation Provider, (ii) all reasonable and
162
    
documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, (iii) all out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof and (iv) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses, taxes, assessments and other charges incurred in connection with any filing, registration, recording or perfection of any security interest contemplated by any Security Document or any other document referred to therein. Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall not be responsible for the reimbursement of any fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Valuation Provider incurred pursuant to 5.12(b)(iii) in excess of the greater of (x) $200,000 and (y) 0.05% of the total Commitments, in each case in the aggregate incurred for all such fees, costs and expenses in any 12-month period (the “IVP Supplemental Cap”).
(b)    Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (other than Taxes or Other Taxes which shall only be indemnified by the Borrower to the extent provided in Section 2.15), including the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee (other than the allocated costs of internal counsel), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby (including any arrangement entered into with an Independent Valuation Provider), (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit) or (iii) any direct, indirect, actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding (including any investigation or inquiry) relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and whether brought by the Borrower, any Indemnitee or a third party and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee, (y) a material breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee’s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or (z) a claim between any Indemnitee or Indemnitees, on the one hand, and any other Indemnitee or Indemnitees, on the other hand (other than (1) any dispute involving claims against the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, in each case in their
163
    
respective capacities as such, and (2) claims arising out of any act or omission by the Borrower and/or its Related Parties).
The Borrower shall not be liable to any Indemnitee for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages (other than in respect of any such damages incurred or paid by an Indemnitee to a third party)) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of the Transactions asserted by an Indemnitee against the Borrower or any other Obligor; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not be deemed to impair or affect the obligations of the Borrower under the preceding provisions of this subsection (including reimbursement of such amounts required to be paid by an Indemnity to a third party).
(c)    Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section (and without limiting its obligation to do so) or to the extent that the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Valuation Provider incurred pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(iii) exceed the IVP Supplemental Cap for any 12-month period (provided that prior to incurring expenses in excess of the IVP Supplemental Cap, the Administrative Agent shall have afforded the Lenders an opportunity to consult with the Administrative Agent regarding such expenses), each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.
(d)    Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unauthorized Persons of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
(e)    Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
(f)    No Fiduciary Relationship. The Administrative Agent, each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Lenders”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, their stockholders and/or their affiliates. The Borrower, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries, agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory,
164
    
fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between the Lender, on the one hand, and the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, its stockholders or its Affiliates, on the other. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries each acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) except as otherwise provided in any of the Loan Documents, no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their stockholders or affiliates (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, their stockholders or their affiliates on other matters) and (y) each Lender is acting hereunder solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, their management or stockholders. The Borrower and each Obligor each acknowledge and agree that it has consulted legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. The Borrower and each Obligor each agree that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services hereunder of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary duty to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, in connection with such transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto.
SECTION 9.04 Successors and Assigns.
(a)    Assignments Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Lender which is not in accordance with this Section shall be treated as provided in the last sentence of Section 9.04(b)(iii)). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b)    Assignments by Lenders.
(i)    Assignments Generally. Subject to the conditions set forth in clause (ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans and LC Exposure at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of:
165
    
(A)    the Borrower; provided that (i) no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, or, if a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee, and (ii) the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received written notice thereof; and
(B)    the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank; provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank shall be required for an assignment by a Lender to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender with prior written notice by such assigning Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Borrower’s consent shall be required with respect to an assignment to any Disqualified Lender unless an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) has occurred and is continuing. The Administrative Agent shall provide, and the Borrower hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent to provide, the Disqualified Lender list to each Lender requesting the same.
(ii)    Certain Conditions to Assignments. Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
(A)    except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans and LC Exposure of a Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans and LC Exposure of a Class of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(B)    each partial assignment of Commitments or Loans and LC Exposure of a Class shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Class of Commitments and Loans and LC Exposure;
(C)    the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee shall not be payable in connection with an assignment to a Lender or to an Affiliate of a Lender), for which the Borrower and the Guarantors shall not be obligated (except in the case of an assignment pursuant to Section 2.18(b)); and
166
    
(D)    the assignee, if it shall not already be a Lender of the applicable Class, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
(iii)    Effectiveness of Assignments. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (f) of this Section.
(c)    Maintenance of Registers by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount and stated interest of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Registers” and each individually, a “Register”). The entries in the Registers shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Registers pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Registers shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)    Acceptance of Assignments by Administrative Agent. Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(e)    Special Purposes Vehicles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle other than a Disqualified Lender (an “SPC”) owned or administered by such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that
167
    
such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to make any Loan by any SPC, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement, make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof, (iii) the rights of any such SPC shall be derivative of the rights of the Granting Lender, and such SPC shall be subject to all of the restrictions upon the Granting Lender herein contained, and (iv) no SPC shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13 (or any other increased costs protection provision), 2.14 or 2.15. Each SPC shall be conclusively presumed to have made arrangements with its Granting Lender for the exercise of voting and other rights hereunder in a manner which is acceptable to the SPC, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower, and each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Obligors shall be entitled to rely upon and deal solely with the Granting Lender with respect to Loans made by or through its SPC. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by the Granting Lender.
Each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, in respect of claims arising out of this Agreement; provided that the Granting Lender for each SPC hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage and expense arising out of their inability to institute any such proceeding against its SPC. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, any SPC may (i) without the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting Lender or to any financial institutions providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such SPC to fund the Loans made by such SPC or to support the securities (if any) issued by such SPC to fund such Loans (but nothing contained herein shall be construed in derogation of the obligation of the Granting Lender to make Loans hereunder); provided that neither the consent of the SPC or of any such assignee shall be required for amendments or waivers hereunder except for those amendments or waivers for which the consent of participants is required under paragraph (f) below, and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis (in the same manner described in Section 9.13(b)) any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.
(f)    Participations. Any Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities other than a Disqualified Lender (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
168
    
Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (g) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including Sections 2.15(f) and (g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Sections 2.15(f) and (g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.18 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.18 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.16(d) as though it were a Lender hereunder. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts and stated interest of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (each a “Participant Register”); provided, that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in each Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as the Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(g)    Limitations on Rights of Participants. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with paragraphs (c) and (f) of Section 2.15 as though it were a Lender (it being understood that that the documentation required under Section 2.15(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender).
(h)    Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central
169
    
bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(i)    No Assignments or Participations to the Borrower or Affiliates or Certain Other Persons. Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may (i) assign or participate any interest in any Commitment, Loan or LC Exposure held by it hereunder to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent of each Lender, or (ii) assign any interest in any Commitment, Loan or LC Exposure held by it hereunder to a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person) or to any Person known by such Lender at the time of such assignment to be a Defaulting Lender, a Subsidiary of a Defaulting Lender or a Person who, upon consummation of such assignment would be a Defaulting Lender.
(j)    Multicurrency Lenders. Any assignment by a Multicurrency Lender, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to any Borrower, must be to a Person that is able to fund and receive payments on account of each outstanding Agreed Foreign Currency at such time without the need to obtain any authorization referred to in clause (c) of the definition of “Agreed Foreign Currency”.
(k)    Certain matters Relating to Disqualified Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Lenders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a Disqualified Lender or (y) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Loans, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Disqualified Lender. The list of Disqualified Lenders will be made available by the Administrative Agent to any Lender, participant or potential Lender or participant upon request.
SECTION 9.05 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
170
    
SECTION 9.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.
(a)    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy or electronic mail shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
(b)    Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
SECTION 9.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
SECTION 9.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever Currency) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender, the Issuing Bank or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Obligor against any of and all the obligations of any Obligor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document held by such Lender or Issuing Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or Issuing Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be contingent and unmatured, or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or Issuing Bank different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such Indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such
171
    
Lender, Issuing Bank or Affiliate may have; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender exercises any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off will be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17 and, pending such payment, will be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders and (b) the Defaulting Lender will provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
SECTION 9.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.
(a)    Governing Law. This Agreement and he other Loan Documents shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.
(b)    Submission to Jurisdiction. The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
(c)    Waiver of Venue. The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
(d)    Service of Process. Each party to this Agreement (i) irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01 and (ii) agrees that service as provided in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01 is sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over such party in any proceeding in any court and otherwise constitutes effective and binding service in every respect. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
SECTION 9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
172
    
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
SECTION 9.11 Judgment Currency. This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of Dollars or any Foreign Currency, as the case may be (the “Specified Currency”), and payment in New York City or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case may be (the “Specified Place”), is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency. The payment obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement shall not be discharged or satisfied by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the “Second Currency”), the rate of exchange that shall be applied shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document (in this Section called an “Entitled Person”) shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due from the Borrower hereunder in the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and the Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in the Specified Currency, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due from the Borrower to such Entitled Person in the Specified Currency hereunder exceeds the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred.
SECTION 9.12 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.
SECTION 9.13 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality.
173
    
(a)    Treatment of Certain Information. The Borrower acknowledges that from time to time financial advisory, investment banking and other services may be offered or provided to the Borrower or one or more of its Subsidiaries (in connection with this Agreement or otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more subsidiaries or affiliates of such Lender and the Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender to share any information delivered to such Lender by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such subsidiary or affiliate, it being understood that any such subsidiary or affiliate receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section as if it were a Lender hereunder. Such authorization shall survive the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
(b)    Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent (including in its capacity as Collateral Agent), the Lenders and the Issuing Bank agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap, derivative or securitization transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations or (iii) to any credit insurance provider relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the Loans and (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the Loans, (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Issuing Bank or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or (j) in connection with the Lenders’ right to grant a security interest pursuant to Section 9.04(h) to the Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank, or subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any other pledgee or assignee pursuant to Section 9.04(h).
For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses (including any Portfolio Investments), other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Date, such
174
    
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
(c)    Confidentiality of COF Rates. The Administrative Agent and the Borrower agree to keep each COF Rate confidential and not to disclose it to anyone, and the Borrower further agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to not disclose any COF Rate, in each case, except for the following: (i) the Administrative Agent may disclose any COF Rate to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.12(a), (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may disclose any COF Rate to any of its Affiliates and any of its or their officers, directors, employees, professional advisers and auditors, if any person to whom that COF Rate is to be disclosed is informed in writing of its confidential nature and that it may be price-sensitive information except that there shall be no requirement to so inform if, in the opinion of the disclosing party, it is not practicable to do so in the circumstances, (iii) to any person to whom information is required to be disclosed in connection with, and for the purposes of, any litigation, arbitration, administrative or other investigations, proceedings or disputes if the person to whom that COF Rate is to be disclosed is informed in writing of its confidential nature and that it may be price-sensitive information except that there shall be no requirement to so inform if, in the opinion of the disclosing party, it is not practicable to do so in the circumstance, or (iv) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process. The Administrative Agent and the Borrower agree to, and the Borrower shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (to the extent permitted by law and regulation) (x) inform each relevant Lender of the circumstances of any disclosure made pursuant to this Section 9.13(c) and (y) notify each relevant Lender upon becoming aware that any information has been disclosed in breach of this Section 9.13(c). No Default or Event of Default shall arise under Article VII(f) by reason only of the failure of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with this Section 9.13(c).
SECTION 9.14 USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Obligor, which information includes the name and address of such Obligor and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Obligor in accordance with said Act. The Obligors will, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation.
SECTION 9.15 Termination. Promptly (and in any event within 3 Business Days) upon the Termination Date, the Administrative Agent shall direct the Collateral Agent to, on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, deliver to Borrower such termination statements and releases and other documents reasonably necessary or appropriate to evidence the termination of this Agreement, the Loan Documents, and each of the
175
    
documents securing the obligations hereunder as the Borrower may reasonably request, all at the sole cost and expense of the Borrower.
SECTION 9.16 Acknowledgment and Consent to Bail-In of EEAAffected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEAAffected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEAthe applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
(a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEAthe applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEAAffected Financial Institution; and
(b)    the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEAAffected Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEAthe applicable Resolution Authority.
SECTION 9.17 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the Maximum Rate. If Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Secured Obligations hereunder.
SECTION 9.18 Acknowledgement Regarding any Supported QFCs To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedging Agreements or any other agreements or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support”) and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under
176
    
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States)
(a)    In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
(b)    As used in this Section 9.18, the following terms have the following meanings:
(i)    “BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. § 1841(k)) of such party.
(ii)    “Covered Entity” means any of the following:
(A)    a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R.§ 252.82(b);
(B)    a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R.§ 47.3(b); or
(C)    a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R.§ 382.2(b).
(iii)    “Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, §§ 12 C.F.R.§ 252.82(b), 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.
177
    
(iv)    “QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. § 5390(c)(8)(D).
