2.    Representations and Warranties. As a material inducement to the Lenders and Administrative Agent to execute and deliver this Amendment, the Company represents and warrants to the Lenders and Administrative Agent (with the knowledge and intent that Administrative Agent and the Lenders party hereto are relying upon the same in entering into this Amendment) that: (a) the Company and the Guarantors have all requisite authority and power to execute, deliver, and perform their respective obligations under this Amendment and the Guarantors’ Consent and Agreement, as the case may be, which execution, delivery, and performance have been duly authorized by all necessary action, require no Governmental Approvals, and do not violate the respective certificates of incorporation or organization, bylaws, or operating agreement, or other organizational or formation documents of such entities; (b) upon execution and delivery by the Company, the Guarantors, Administrative Agent, and the Lenders party hereto, this Amendment will constitute the legal and binding obligation of each of the Company, and the Guarantors, enforceable against such entities in accordance with the terms of this Amendment, except as that enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity or by bankruptcy or insolvency laws or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally; (c) before and after giving effect to this Amendment, all representations and warranties in the Loan Papers are true and correct as though made on the date hereof, except to the extent that any of them speak to a specific date or the facts on which any of them are based have been changed by transactions contemplated or permitted by the Credit Agreement; and (d) after giving effect to this Amendment, no Default or Potential Default has occurred and is continuing.
3.    Conditions Precedent to Effective Date. This Amendment shall be effective on the date (the “Effective Date”) upon which Administrative Agent receives each of the following items:

(a)    counterparts of this Amendment executed by the Company, Administrative Agent and the Lenders;
(b)    the Guarantors’ Consent and Agreement executed by each Guarantor;
(c)    payment of all fees payable on or prior to the Effective Date pursuant to the Credit Agreement and Fee Letter (as amended by that certain Fee Letter Amendment dated of even date hereof);

2

Agent, to the extent not otherwise delivered pursuant to Sections 3(d) above, a legal opinion of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, LLP covering each Guarantor formed in Colorado, in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent. The failure by the Company to perform or cause to be performed such condition subsequent on or before the date applicable thereto shall constitute an immediate Event of Default without further grace period.
5.    Conversion to SOFR. After the Effective Date and following delivery of a Loan Notice, each conversion of Loans from one Type to another, or a continuation of Loans, shall be a request for a new Loan bearing interest at the Term SOFR Rate or Daily SOFR Rate, as requested by the Company; provided, that, in any case, to the extent any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (as defined in the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effectiveness of this Amendment) is outstanding on the Effective Date, such Loan shall continue to bear interest at the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effectiveness of this Amendment) until the end of the current Interest Period applicable to such Loan. If the Company fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation of any such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, then the applicable Loan shall be made as, or converted to, a Daily SOFR Rate Loan at the end of the current Interest Period applicable to such Loan.
6.    Expenses. The Company shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses paid or incurred by Administrative Agent incident to this Amendment, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of Administrative Agent’s counsel in connection with the negotiation, preparation, delivery, and execution of this Amendment and any related documents.
7.    Ratifications.

8.    Miscellaneous. Unless stated otherwise herein, (a) the singular number includes the plural, and vice versa, and words of any gender include each other gender, in each case, as appropriate, (b) headings and captions shall not be construed in interpreting provisions of this Amendment, (c) this Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, (d) if any part of this Amendment is for any reason found to be unenforceable, all other portions of it shall nevertheless remain enforceable, (e) this Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if all signatories had signed the same document, and all of those counterparts shall be construed together to constitute the same document and facsimile and electronic (e.g. pdf) signatures shall constitute originals for all intents and purposes hereof, (f) this Amendment is a “Loan Paper” referred to in the Credit Agreement, and the provisions relating to Loan Papers in Section 15 of the Credit Agreement are incorporated herein by reference, (g) this Amendment, the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, and the other Loan Papers constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersede any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof, and (h) except as provided in this Amendment, the Credit Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Papers are unchanged and are ratified and confirmed.

9.    Parties. This Amendment binds and inures to the benefit of the Company, the Guarantors, Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and their respective successors and assigns.
10.    Electronic Signatures. This Amendment and any document, amendment, approval, consent, information, notice, certificate, request, statement, disclosure or authorization related to this Amendment (each a “Communication”), including Communications required to be in writing, may, if agreed by Administrative Agent, be in the form of an Electronic Record and may be executed using Electronic Signatures, including, without limitation, facsimile and/or .pdf. The Company agrees that any Electronic Signature (including, without limitation, facsimile or .pdf) on or associated with any Communication shall be valid and binding on the Company to the same extent as a manual, original signature, and that any Communication entered into by Electronic Signature, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with the terms thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed original signature was delivered to Administrative Agent. Any Communication may be executed in as many counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Communication. For the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this paragraph may include, without limitation, use or acceptance by Administrative Agent of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically signed Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. Administrative Agent may, at its option, create one or more copies of any Communication in the form of an imaged Electronic Record (“Electronic Copy”), which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of Administrative Agent’s business, and destroy the original paper document. All Communications in the form of an Electronic Record, including an Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Administrative Agent is under no obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, (a) to the extent Administrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of the Company without further verification and (b) upon the request of Administrative Agent any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by a manually executed, original counterpart. For purposes hereof, “Electronic Record” and “Electronic Signature” shall have the meanings assigned to them, respectively, by 15 USC §7006, as it may be amended from time to time.
The parties hereto have executed this Amendment in multiple counterparts as of the date first above written.

(b)    Each Lender shall remit its Commitment Percentage of each requested Revolver Loan or Term Loan to Administrative Agent’s principal office in Dallas, Texas, in funds that are available for immediate use by Administrative Agent by 12:00 noon on the applicable Loan Date, in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars, and not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Loan in an Alternative Currency, in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Subject to receipt of such funds, Administrative Agent shall (unless to its actual knowledge any of the applicable conditions precedent have not been satisfied by Borrower or waived by Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders or Required Term Loan Lenders, as applicable) make such funds available to Borrower as directed in the Loan Notice; provided however, that if on the date of such Loan Notice with respect to a Revolver Loan, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Revolver Loans shall be provided, first, to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowing, and then, to Borrower as provided herein.

(c)    Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Loan that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Loan (or, in the case of any BaseDaily SOFR Rate Loan, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such BaseDaily SOFR Rate Loan), Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.2(b) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate
45

determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing, or similar fees customarily charged by Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to BaseDaily SOFR Rate Loans. If Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to Borrower the amount of such interest paid by Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Revolver Loan or Term Loan to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Loan. Any payment by Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent. A notice of Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

(d)    Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, ifWith respect to any payment that Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder as to which Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the “Rescindable Amount”): (1) Borrower has not in fact made such payment,; (2) Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) Administrative agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each Lender or the applicablesuch L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amountRescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender or the applicablesuch L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A notice of Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (d) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

(e)    The obligations of Lenders hereunder to make Revolver Loans and Term Loans, to fund participations in L/Cs and Swing Line Loans, and to make payments pursuant to Section 15.4(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation, or to make any payment under Section 15.4(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation, or to make its payment under Section 15.4(c).

(f)    Without limitation of any other conditions herein, a Loan or continuation of or conversion to Term SOFR Rate Loans shall not be permitted if:

(i)    an Event of Default or a Default has occurred and is continuing and has not been waived by the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as applicable;

46

(ii)    after giving effect to the requested Loan or continuation of or conversion to Term SOFR Rate Loans under the Revolver Facility or Term Loan Facility, as applicable, the sum of all Loans under such facility would exceed the Commitments under the such facility;

(iii)    after giving effect to all Loans, no more than ten (10) Term Reference Rate Interest Periods may be in effect at one time;

(iv)    the amount of Term SOFR Rate Loans requested in the request for Borrowing or continuation of or conversion to Term SOFR Rate Loans is not in a principal amount of at least $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof;

(v)    the requested interest period does not conform to the definition of Interest Period herein; or

(vi)    any of the circumstances referred to in Section 4.3 hereof shall apply with respect to the requested Loan or continuation of or conversion to Term SOFR Rate Loans.

(g)    Borrower may not request an advance of, or conversion to, Base Rate Loans unless Daily SOFR Rate Loans and Term SOFR Rate Loans are unavailable, as further provided herein.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all of the portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by Borrower, Administrative Agent, and such Lender.

(i) With respect to Daily Simple SOFR and Term SOFR, Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.

2.3    L/C Subfacility.

(a)    The L/C Commitment.

(i)    Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) each L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolver Lenders set forth in this Section 2.3, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the L/C Expiration Date, to issue L/Cs in Dollars or with respect to the Australian L/C Issuer, the Alternative Currency, for the account of Borrower or its Subsidiaries in an aggregate amount not to exceed such L/C Issuer’s L/C Commitment,
47

and to amend or renew L/Cs previously issued by it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor sight drafts under the L/Cs; and (B) Revolver Lenders severally agree to participate in L/Cs issued for the account of Borrower; provided that no L/C Issuer shall be obligated to make any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any L/C, and no Revolver Lender shall be obligated to participate in any L/C, if as of the date of such L/C Credit Extension (after giving effect to any proposed L/C Credit Extension on such date), (x) the Revolver Commitment Usage would exceed the Revolver Commitment, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolver Loans of such Revolving Lender, plus such Revolver Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Exposure, plus such Revolving Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the Outstanding Amounts of all Swing Line Loans would exceed such Revolver Lender’s Revolver Commitment, or (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Exposure would exceed the L/C Sublimit. Each request by Borrower for the issuance or amendment of an L/C shall be deemed to be a representation by Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Borrower’s ability to obtain L/Cs shall be fully revolving; accordingly Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain L/Cs to replace L/Cs that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing L/Cs shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

(ii)    The L/C Issuers shall not issue any L/C if:

(A)    subject to Section 2.3(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested L/C would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last renewal, unless Required Revolver Lenders have approved such expiry date or unless the requested L/C is a Bond L/C, in which case the Bond L/C will expire in accordance with the terms set forth in the applicable Bond L/C as approved by the applicable L/C Issuer and Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.3(i); or

(B)    the expiry date of the requested L/C would occur after the L/C Expiration Date, unless (x) all the Revolver Lenders and the applicable L/C Issuer have approved such expiry date or (y) such L/C is cash collateralized on terms and pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer.

(iii)    The L/C Issuers shall not be under any obligation to issue any L/C if:

(A)    any order, judgment, or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the applicable L/C Issuer from issuing such L/C, or any Law applicable to the applicable L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of Law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the applicable L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that such L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such L/C in particular or shall impose upon the applicable L/C Issuer with respect to such L/C any restriction, reserve, or capital requirement (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the applicable L/C Issuer any
48

unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;

(B)    the issuance of such L/C would violate one or more policies of the applicable L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;

(C)    such L/C is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars (or the Alternative Currency with respect to L/Cs issued by the Australian L/C Issuer);

(D)    any Revolver Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the applicable L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with Borrower or such Revolver Lender to eliminate such L/C Issuer’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 3.15(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the L/C then proposed to be issued or that L/C and all other L/C Exposure as to which such L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion; or

(E)    the Australian L/C Issuer does not as of the issuance date of the requested L/C issue L/Cs in the Alternative Currency.

(iii)    No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to amend any L/C if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such L/C in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such L/C does not accept the proposed amendment to such L/C.

(iv)    No L/C Issuer shall amend any L/C if such L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue the L/C in its amended form under the terms hereof.

(v)    Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolver Lenders with respect to any L/C issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and such L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to Administrative Agent in Section 14 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer in connection with each L/C issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and L/C Agreements pertaining to such L/C as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent” as used in Section 14 included such L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to such L/C Issuer.

(b)    Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit: Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.

(i)    Each L/C shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of Borrower delivered to the applicable L/C Issuer (with a copy to Administrative Agent) in the form of an L/C Agreement, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of Borrower. Such L/C Agreement may be sent by facsimile, by United States mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by the applicable L/C Issuer, by personal delivery or by any other means acceptable to the L/C Issuer. Such L/C Agreement must be received by the applicable L/
49

C Issuer and Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the applicable L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of an L/C, such L/C Agreement shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested L/C (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and currency thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) the purpose and nature of the requested L/C and such other matters as the applicable L/C Issuer (or, in the case of the Bond L/Cs, the applicable L/C Issuer or Administrative Agent) may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding L/C, such L/C Agreement shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer (A) the L/C to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the applicable L/C Issuer (or, in the case of the Bond L/Cs, the applicable L/C Issuer or Administrative Agent) may require. Additionally, Borrower shall furnish to the applicable L/C Issuer and Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested L/C issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as such L/C Issuer or Administrative Agent may require.

(ii)    Promptly after receipt of any L/C Agreement, the applicable L/C Issuer will confirm with Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that Administrative Agent has received a copy of such L/C Agreement from Borrower and, if not, such L/C Issuer will provide Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the applicable L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolver Lender, Administrative Agent or Borrower, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable L/C, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article VII shall not be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue an L/C for the account of Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with such L/C Issuer’s usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each L/C, each Revolver Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable L/C Issuer a risk participation in such L/C in an amount equal to the product of such Revolver Lender’s Commitment Percentage times the amount of such L/C.

(iii)    If Borrower so requests in any applicable L/C Agreement, the applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue an L/C that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension L/C”); provided that any such Auto-Extension L/C must permit the applicable L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such L/C) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “Nonextension Notice Date”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such L/C is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable L/C Issuer, Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension L/C has been issued, Revolver Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuer to permit the
50

extension of such L/C at any time to an expiry date not later than the L/C Expiration Date; provided, however, that the applicable L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) such L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation at such time to issue such L/C in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.3(a)(ii), Section 2.3(a)(iii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Nonextension Notice Date (1) from Administrative Agent that Required Revolver Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from Administrative Agent, any Revolver Lender, or Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 7.2 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the applicable L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.

(iv)    Promptly after its delivery of any L/C or any amendment to an L/C to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable L/C Issuer will also deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such L/C or amendment.

(c)    Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

(i)    Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any L/C of any notice of a drawing under such L/C, the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify Borrower and Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of an L/C denominated in the Alternative Currency, Borrower shall reimburse the Australian L/C Issuer in the Alternative Currency, unless (A) the Australian L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, Borrower shall have notified the Australian L/C Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that Borrower will reimburse the Australian L/C Issuer in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under an L/C denominated in the Alternative Currency, the Australian L/C Issuer shall notify Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under an L/C to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the Australian L/C Issuer under an L/C to be reimbursed in the Alternative Currency (each such date, an “Honor Date”), Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Issuer through Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency. In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in the Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the second sentence in this Section 2.3(c)(i) and (B) the Dollar amount paid by Borrower, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify the Australian L/C Issuer for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing. If Borrower fails to so reimburse such L/C Issuer by such time, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolver Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of an L/C denominated in the Alternative Currency) (the “Unreimbursed Amount”), and the amount of such Revolver Lender’s Commitment Percentage thereof. In such event, Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a
51

BaseDaily SOFR Rate Loan hereunder to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.1 for the principal amount of BaseDaily SOFR Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolver Commitment and the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice). Any notice given by any L/C Issuer or Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

(ii)    Each Revolver Lender (including any Revolver Lender acting as an L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) make funds available (and Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer in Dollars at Administrative Agent’s Office in an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by Administrative Agent; whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(c)(iii), each Revolver Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a BaseDaily SOFR Rate Loan hereunder to Borrower in such amount. Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable L/C Issuer in Dollars.

(iii)    With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolver Loan because the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolver Lender’s payment to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.3.

(iv)    Until each Revolver Lender funds its portion of a Revolver Loan or participation in an L/C Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any L/C, interest in respect of such Revolver Lender’s Commitment Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer.

(v)    Each Revolver Lender’s obligation to reimburse the L/C Issuers for amounts drawn under L/Cs (whether by making a Revolver Loans or funding its participation in an L/C Borrowing), as contemplated by this Section 2.3(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which such Revolver Lender may have against the applicable L/C Issuer, Borrower, or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Potential Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolver Lender’s obligation to make Revolver Loans pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 (other than delivery by Borrower of a Loan Notice). No funding of a participation in an L/C Borrowing shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of
52

Borrower to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any L/C, together with interest as provided herein.

(vi)    If any Revolver Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Revolver Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3(c) by the time specified in Section 2.3(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the applicable L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolver Lender (acting through Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the applicable L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by such L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing, or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolver Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolver Lender’s participation in the L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the applicable L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolver Lender (through Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(d)    Repayment of Participations.

(i)    At any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any L/C and has received from any Revolver Lender such Revolver Lender’s funding of its participation in the related L/C Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.3(c), if Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by Administrative Agent), Administrative Agent will distribute to such Revolver Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof in Dollars (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Revolver Lender’s participation in the L/C Borrowing was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by Administrative Agent.

(ii)    If any payment received by Administrative Agent for the account of any L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 15.12 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the applicable L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolver Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolver Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Revolver Lenders under this clause (d) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

(e)    Obligations Absolute. The obligation of Borrower to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for each drawing under each L/C and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:
53


(i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of such L/C, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

(ii)    the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off, defense, or other right that Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such L/C (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the applicable L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such L/C or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

(iii) any draft, demand, certificate, or other document presented under such L/C proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid, or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such L/C;

(iv)    waiver by any L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for such L/C Issuer’s protection and not the protection of Borrower or any waiver by such L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice Borrower;

(v)    honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such L/C requires that demand be in the form of a draft;

(vi)    any payment made by the L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such L/C if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC, the ISP or the UCP, as applicable;

(vii)    any payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under such L/C against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such L/C; or any payment made by the applicable L/C Issuer under such L/C to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver, or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such L/C, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;

(viii)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Borrower; or

(ix)    any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the Alternative Currency to Borrower or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally.

Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each L/C and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with Borrower’s instructions or other irregularity, Borrower will immediately notify the applicable L/C Issuer. Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the applicable L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
54


(f)    Role of L/C Issuers Each Revolver Lender and Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under an L/C, the applicable L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates, and documents expressly required by the L/C) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuers, any Related Party of Administrative Agent, or any of the respective correspondents, participants, or assignees of the L/C Issuers shall be liable to any Revolver Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of Revolver Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders, Required Term Loan Lenders or Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any L/C or L/C Agreement. Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any L/C; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude Borrower’s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at Law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuers, any Related Party of Administrative Agent, or any of the respective correspondents, participants, or assignees of any L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.3(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and an L/C Issuer may be liable to Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by Borrower which Borrower proves were caused by such L/C Issuer’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C Issuer’s willful failure to pay under any L/C after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of an L/C. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, an L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and an L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign an L/C or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. Each L/C Issuer may send an L/C or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary.

(g)    Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and Borrower when an L/C is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing L/C), (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby L/C and each Bond L/C, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (“UCP”), as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance, shall apply to each commercial L/C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to Borrower for, and such L/C Issuer’s rights and remedies against Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of such L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any L/C or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where such L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade – International Financial Services Association
55

(BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any L/C chooses such law or practice.

(h)    Conflict with L/C Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any L/C Agreement, the terms hereof shall control.

(i)    Bond L/Cs. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary set forth in this Section 2.3:
(i)    (A)    The Bond L/Cs shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable Law; provided however, that (1) such Bond L/Cs may have expiration dates later than thirteen months from the date of issuance, so long as such date is not later than the L/C Expiration Date; and (2) the terms of such Bond L/Cs must be acceptable to the applicable L/C Issuer and Administrative Agent, and, (I) subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(i)(ii) and 2.3(i)(iii), may provide for the reinstatement of drawn portions of the Bond L/C, whether or not reimbursement has been received (which may have the effect of increasing the amount of such Bond L/C), (II) may provide for automatic extensions thereof, so long as such terms comply with the auto extension provisions set forth in Section 2.3(b)(iii) hereof, and (III) may contain provisions whereby the applicable L/C Issuer is granted certain Rights in collateral and voting Rights under the related Bond Documents, which Rights are expressly assigned by the applicable L/C Issuer to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Revolver Lenders pursuant to Section 2.3(i)(iv) herein.

(B)    Borrower may request that an L/C Issuer issue Bond L/Cs by providing at least 30 days prior written notice of such request to the applicable L/C Issuer, and by delivering a certificate at least 30 days prior to the issuance of any Bond L/C to Administrative Agent demonstrating the Companies’ pro forma compliance with the financial covenant set forth in Section 11.1 herein, after giving effect to the issuance of any such Bonds and, without duplication, any Debt incurred by Borrower or any Company in support thereof, and certifying that no Default or Potential Default exists or would result after giving effect thereto.

(ii)    In the event that the proceeds of any drawing under any Bond L/C are used to pay the purchase price of Bonds tendered or deemed tendered by the owner thereof pursuant to the related Bond Documents (such drawing, including the drawing of any accrued interest on the tendered Bonds, a “Bond Purchase Drawing”), then the stated amount of such Bond L/C will be temporarily reduced by the amount of such drawing, subject to automatic reinstatement (whether or not reimbursement for any drawings thereunder has been received or the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 have been satisfied, and without further approval from Revolver Lenders) pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Bond L/C by an amount equal to the Bond Purchase Drawing, so long as (A) the applicable L/C Issuer (or Administrative Agent, as assignee of such L/C Issuer) has been properly accounted for on the securities depository’s records as the beneficial owner of such Bonds purchased with the proceeds (or portion thereof) of the Bond L/C, or (B) such Bonds have been delivered to the appropriate custodian and registered as directed by such L/C Issuer (or Administrative Agent, as assignee of such L/C Issuer), or (C) to the extent provided for in the applicable Bond L/C, such Bonds have been remarketed in accordance with the terms of the applicable Bond Documents and
56

released by the applicable L/C Issuer; provided however, that if the repurchased Bonds are not transferred to such L/C Issuer (or Administrative Agent, as assignee of such L/C Issuer) as required in clauses (A) and (B) preceding, then the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify Administrative Agent (who shall subsequently notify Revolver Lenders) of such failure. Unless otherwise directed by Required Revolver Lenders, the applicable L/C Issuer shall then deliver notice to the applicable Trustee prior to the fifth Business Day after any such Bond Purchase Drawing that the amount of such drawing will not be reinstated.

(iii)    If the interest portion of any Bond L/C is drawn by the applicable Trustee to make scheduled interest payments on the outstanding principal amount of the Bonds, then the stated amount of such Bond L/C will be temporarily reduced by the amount of such drawing, subject to automatic reinstatement of the interest portion of such Bond L/C (whether or not reimbursement for any drawings thereunder has been received or the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 have been satisfied, and without further approval from Revolver Lenders) pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Bond L/C. Subject to compliance with Section 2.3(b) herein, the stated amount of the related Bond L/C may be increased as required by the related Bond Documents (to reflect an increase in the maximum rate of interest or number of days of accrued interest covered by such Bond L/C or otherwise).

(iv)    All liens and security interests securing reimbursement obligations and other obligations owed to the applicable L/C Issuer of any Bond L/C under the related Bond Documents (including, without limitation, any L/C Borrowing), any rights in and to any Bonds or other certificates of indebtedness issued to such L/C Issuer under the related Bond Documents, and any voting rights or other rights created in favor of such L/C Issuer under or pursuant to or in connection with any related Bond Documents (collectively, the “Bond Rights”), now or hereafter existing in favor of such L/C Issuer, are hereby assigned and conveyed by the applicable L/C Issuer to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of Revolver Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any Bond L/C, any Bonds, or certificates of indebtedness purchased from the owner thereof by the applicable Trustee with funds received pursuant to a drawing under any Bond L/C shall be registered in the name of Administrative Agent and shall be delivered to or held by Administrative Agent or such other entity as may be specified by the applicable L/C Issuer and approved by Administrative Agent in a written instrument delivered to the applicable Trustee, for the benefit of the applicable L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent, and the other Revolver Lenders. Each L/C Issuer of a Bond L/C agrees to execute all such other assignments, conveyances, financing statements, and other documents required by Administrative Agent to effect the requirements of this Section 2.3(i)(iv); provided that, Revolver Lenders, Administrative Agent, and such L/C Issuer agree that in the event any Bonds or certificates of indebtedness are issued to such L/C Issuer (or Administrative Agent as the assignee of such L/C Issuer) as a result of a drawing by the applicable Trustee under the Bond L/C for which such L/C Issuer is not immediately reimbursed, and subsequently the Bonds are remarketed and such L/C Issuer is reimbursed for all amounts so advanced (which reimbursement may be a repayment of any Revolver Loan disbursed by Revolver Lenders as payment of the related L/C reimbursement obligations under Section 2.3(c) or a repayment of an L/C Borrowing), then any Bonds or certificates of indebtedness shall be released by Administrative Agent
57

and delivered to such Trustee without any further authorization from Revolver Lenders or such L/C Issuer.

(v)    To the extent Rights (including, without limitation, voting rights, rights to provide notice and elect remedies, and rights to approve waivers, consents, or amendments of the related Bond Documents) are created in favor of the L/C Issuers of any Bond L/C, such Rights (other than ministerial, non discretionary Rights) may only be exercised with the consent, or in accordance with the directions, of Required Revolver Lenders.

(vi)    In the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Section 2.3 relating to Bond L/Cs and the terms and provisions of any Loan Paper relating to L/Cs (other than Bond L/Cs), the terms and provisions of this Section 2.3 shall control.

(j)    L/Cs Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that an L/C issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary of Borrower or a Metro District, Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such L/C. Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of L/Cs for the account of Subsidiaries of Borrower or a Metro District inures to the benefit of Borrower, and that Borrower’s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.

2.4    Swing Line Loans.

(a)    The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Swing Line Lender agrees (severally, not jointly), in reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolver Lenders set forth in this Section 2.4, to make loans (each such loan, a “Swing Line Loan”) to Borrower from time to time on any Business Day prior to the Termination Date for the Revolver Facility in an aggregate amount up to such Swing Line Lender’s Swing Line Commitment, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Commitment Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Revolver Loans and L/C Exposure of such Revolver Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Revolver Lender’s Revolver Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans made by the Swing Line Lenders shall not exceed the Swing Line Sublimit, (ii) the Revolver Commitment Usage shall not exceed the Revolver Commitment, and (iii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolver Loans of any Revolver Lender, plus such Revolver Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Exposure, plus such Revolver Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Revolver Lender’s Revolver Commitment, and provided, further, that Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.4, prepay under Section 3.2, and reborrow under this Section 2.4. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Daily Floating LIBOR Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Revolver Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Revolver Lender’s Commitment Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line Loan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (a), a
58

Swing Line Lender shall not be obligated to make Swing Line Loans (x) at a time when any Revolver Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (y) if such Swing Line Lender reasonably believes that a Revolver Lender will become a Defaulting Lender.

(b)    Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon Borrower’s irrevocable notice to either Swing Line Lender and Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone or (B) a Swing Line Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the applicable Swing Line Lender and Administrative Agent of a Swing Line Loan Notice. Each such notice must be received by the applicable Swing Line Lender and Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $1,000,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Promptly after receipt by the applicable Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, such Swing Line Lender will confirm with Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, such Swing Line Lender will notify Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless such Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolver Lender) prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing such Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.4(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 7 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Swing Line Lender will, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to Borrower.

(c)    Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.

(i)    Each Swing Line Lender, as applicable, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes each Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolver Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Revolver Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of the Swing Line Loans owed to such Swing Line Lender. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.2, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.1 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolver Commitment and the conditions set forth in Section 7.2. The applicable Swing Line Lender shall furnish Borrower with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to Administrative Agent. Each Revolver Lender shall make an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the amount specified in such Loan Notice available to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of the applicable Swing Line Lender at Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 12:00 noon on the day specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.4(c)(ii), each Revolver Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to Borrower in such amount. Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable Swing Line Lender.

(ii)    If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by a Revolver Loan in accordance with Section 2.4(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans
59

submitted by the applicable Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by such Swing Line Lender that each Revolver Lender fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loans and each Revolver Lender’s payment to Administrative Agent for the account of such Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.

(iii)    If any Revolver Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolver Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.4(c) by the time specified in Section 2.4(c)(i), such Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolver Lender (acting through Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by such Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of such Swing Line Lender submitted to any Revolver Lender (through Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(iv)    Each Revolver Lender’s obligation to make Revolver Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which such Revolver Lender may have against the applicable Swing Line Lender, Borrower, or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Potential Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event, or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolver Lender’s obligation to make Revolver Loans pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.

(d)     Repayment of Participations.

(i)    At any time after any Revolver Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the applicable Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, such Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Revolver Lender its Commitment Percentage of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Revolver Lender’s risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by such Swing Line Lender.

(ii)    If any payment received by the applicable Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by such Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 15.12 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Revolver Lender shall pay to such Swing Line Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal
60

Funds Rate. Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of such Swing Line Lender. The obligations of Revolver Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligation and the termination of this Agreement.

(e)    Interest for Account of Swing Line Lenders. Each Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing Borrower for interest on its respective Swing Line Loans. Until each Revolver Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.4 to refinance such Revolver Lender’s Commitment Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Commitment Percentage of such Swing Line Loan shall be solely for the account of the applicable Swing Line Lender.

(f)    Payments Directly to Swing Line Lenders. Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the applicable Swing Line Lender.

2.4    [Reserved].

2.5    Increase in Revolver Commitments; Incremental Term Loan Facility.

(a)    Request for Increase in Revolver Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Facility. Provided there exists no Default or Potential Default, upon notice to Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify Lenders), Borrower may, from time to time, request either (i) an increase in the Revolver Commitments, or (ii) the addition of one or more new term loan facilities under this Agreement (each, an “Incremental Term Loan Facility”, and collectively, the “Incremental Term Loan Facilities”), such that, after giving effect thereto, the sum of the Total Commitment and aggregate principal amount of loans under the Incremental Term Loan Facilities do not exceed the Maximum Facility Amount minus the amount of Debt incurred and outstanding pursuant to clause (l) of the definition of “Permitted Debt”; provided, that any such request shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000, and greater integral multiples of $500,000 thereof.

(b)    Additional Lenders. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of Administrative Agent, and each L/C Issuer, and each Swing Line Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), Borrower may:

(i)    in connection with any increase in the Revolver Commitments, (A) invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Revolver Lenders pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent and its counsel (each, a “Joinder Agreement”), and (B) request one or more Revolver Lenders to increase their respective Revolver Commitments hereunder, but each such Revolver Lender shall not be deemed to have agreed to increase its Revolver Commitment unless such Revolver Lender notifies Administrative Agent prior to any deadline specified by Borrower (in consultation with Administrative Agent) of its agreement to increase its Revolver Commitment and the amount of the increase of such Revolver Lender’s Revolver Commitment; and

(ii)    in connection with the addition of any Incremental Term Loan Facility under this Agreement, invite Eligible Assignees or one or more Lenders to become lenders under such Incremental Term Loan Facility pursuant to clause (e) below.

61

(c)    Effective Date and Allocations. If the Revolver Commitments are increased or an Incremental Term Loan Facility is added to this Agreement in accordance with this Section, then Administrative Agent and Borrower shall determine the effective date (the “Increase Effective Date”) and the final allocation thereof. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower, Lenders (including, without limitation, any Eligible Assignee becoming a Lender) and lenders under the Incremental Term Loan Facilities of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.

(d)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase in Revolver Commitments. As a condition precedent to any increase in the Revolver Commitments, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent:

(i)    Joinder Agreements executed by Borrower, Administrative Agent, and each Eligible Assignee becoming a new Revolver Lender hereunder pursuant to Section 2.5(c) hereof, together with a completed Administrative Questionnaire;

(ii)    with respect to any Revolver Lender requesting a Note, a Note executed by Borrower; and

(iii)    a certificate of each Company dated as of the Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of Borrower and each Guarantor (A) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by each such entity approving or consenting to such increase, and (B) in the case of Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (1) the representations and warranties contained in Section 8 and the other Loan Papers are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and (2) no Default or Potential Default exists or would result therefrom. Borrower shall prepay any Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 4.5) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Loans ratable with any revised Commitment Percentages arising from any non-ratable increase in the Commitments under this Section.

(e)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Addition of an Incremental Term Loan Facility. As a condition precedent to the addition of each Incremental Term Loan Facility, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent:

(i)    an amendment, in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent and each lender under such Incremental Term Loan Facility, executed by Borrower, Administrative Agent and each lender under such Incremental Term Loan Facility, which shall include provisions relating to the maturity, pricing, and amortization of the term loan and voting rights of the lenders under such Incremental Term Loan Facility, and such other changes as Administrative Agent and the lenders under such Incremental Term Loan Facility shall deem necessary to effect the increase requested hereby;

(ii)    with respect to any lender under such Incremental Term Loan Facility requesting a promissory note, such promissory note executed by Borrower;

62

(iii)    a completed Administrative Questionnaire from each lender under such Incremental Term Loan Facility; and

(iv)    a certificate of each Company dated as of the Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of Borrower and each Guarantor (A) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by each such entity approving or consenting to such increase, and (B) in the case of Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (1) the representations and warranties contained in Section 8 and the other Loan Papers are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date (provided, that Borrower shall only be required to make certain representations and warranties with respect to any Incremental Term Loan Facility used to consummate an acquisition permitted under Section 10.11), and (2) no Default or Potential Default exists or would result therefrom.

(f)    Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Sections 3.12 or 15.9 to the contrary.

SECTION 3    TERMS OF PAYMENT.

3.1    Notes and Payments.

(a)    The Loans made by each Lender and any L/C Credit Extension shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans or L/C Credit Extension made by Lenders to Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligation. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender or either Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, made through Administrative Agent, Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender (through Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such account or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

(b)    In addition to the accounts and records referred to in clause (a) herein, each Revolver Lender and Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Revolver Lender of participations in L/Cs. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Revolver Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.

(c)    Borrower must make each payment on the Obligation, without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment, or setoff. All payments except with respect
63

to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency by Borrower hereunder shall be made in Dollars to Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at Administrative Agent’s principal office in Dallas, Texas, in funds that will be available for immediate use by Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. on the day due; otherwise, but subject to Section 3.8, those funds continue to accrue interest as if they were received on the next Business Day. All payments by Borrower with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency must be made by the Applicable Time; otherwise, but subject to Section 3.8, those funds continue to accrue interest as if they are received on the next Business Day. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount.

Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender its Commitment Percentage (or other payment share as provided herein) of such payment to which that Lender is entitled on the same day Administrative Agent receives the funds from Borrower if Administrative Agent receives the payment before 1:00 p.m., and otherwise before 1:00 p.m. on the following Business Day. If and to the extent that Administrative Agent does not make payments to Lenders when due, unpaid amounts shall accrue interest at the Federal Funds Rate from the due date until (but not including) the payment date.

3.2    Interest and Principal Payments; Prepayments; Voluntary Commitment Reductions.

(a)    Accrued interest on each Revolver Loan or Term Loan that is a EurocurrencyTerm Reference Rate Loan is due and payable on the last day of its Interest Period and on the Termination Date. If any Interest Period with respect to a Revolver Loan or Term Loan that is a EurocurrencyTerm Reference Rate Loan is a period greater than three months, then accrued interest is also due and payable on the date three months after the commencement of the Interest Period. Accrued interest on each Base Rate Loan and each Swing Line Loan is due and payable on each Quarterly Date and on the Termination Date. Accrued interest on each Daily SOFR Rate Loan is due and payable on the last day of each calendar month and on the Termination Date

(b)    The Revolver Principal Debt is due and payable on the Termination Date for the Revolver Facility.

(c)    Borrower shall repay the outstanding principal amount of each Swing Line Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after such Swing Line Loan is made, and (ii) the Termination Date for the Revolver Facility[Reserved].

(d)    The Term Loan Principal Debt is due and payable in equal quarterly installments, such that five percent (5%) of the Term Loan Principal Debt outstanding on the Second Amendment Closing Date is repaid in each consecutive period of four (4) Quarterly Dates, with the first such payment due on January 31, 2020, and continuing on each consecutive Quarterly
64

Date thereafter. Each quarterly installment of the Term Loan Principal Debt shall be applied first, to the Term Unhedged Tranche until the Term Loan Principal Debt with respect to the Term Unhedged Tranche has been fully paid and second, to the Term Hedged Tranche until the Term Loan Principal Debt with respect to the Term Hedged Tranche has been fully paid. A final payment is due on the Termination Date for the Term Loan Facility in an amount equal to all Term Loan Principal Debt then outstanding.

(e)    If the Revolver Commitment Usage ever exceeds the Revolver Commitment, or if the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Swing Line Loans ever exceeds the Swing Line Commitment, then Borrower shall immediately prepay Revolver Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Exposure in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Exposure pursuant to this Section 3.2(e) unless, after prepayment in full of the Revolver Loans, the Revolver Commitment Usage exceeds the Revolver Commitment then in effect.

(f)    Without premium or penalty and upon giving at least two Business Days prior written and irrevocable notice to Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify Revolver Lenders of its receipt of such notice and its contents), Borrower may terminate all or reduce part of the unused portion of the Revolver Commitment. Each partial reduction (unless the remaining portion of such commitment is less) must be in an amount of not less than $5,000,000 or a greater integral multiple of $1,000,000, and shall be ratable among all Revolver Lenders according to their respective Commitment Percentages. Once terminated or reduced, such commitments may not be reinstated or increased. Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolver Commitment if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Revolver Commitment Usage would exceed the Revolver Commitment. If, after giving effect to any reduction of the Revolver Commitment, or the L/C Sublimit, or the Swing Line Sublimit, exceeds the amount of the Revolver Commitment, such sublimits shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. Administrative Agent will promptly notify Revolver Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Revolver Commitment.

(g)    Borrower may voluntarily prepay all or any part of the Revolver Principal Debt (other than Revolver Principal Debt under the Swing Line Subfacility, which may be prepaid in accordance with clause (h) below) or the Term Loan Principal Debt at any time without premium or penalty, subject to the following conditions:

(i)    Administrative Agent must receive Borrower’s written payment notice (which must be in a form acceptable to Administrative Agent and which shall specify (1) the payment date, and (2) the Type and amount of the Loan(s) to be paid; such notice shall constitute an irrevocable and binding obligation of Borrower to make a payment on the designated date) by 11:00 a.m. on (x) the firstthird Business Day preceding the date of payment of a Revolver Loan or a Term Loan that is a EurocurrencyTerm Reference Rate Loan, and (y) the date of payment of a Daily SOFR Rate Loan or Base Rate Loan;

(ii)    each partial payment must be in a minimum amount of at least $500,000 if a Daily SOFR Rate Loan or Base Rate Loan or $1,000,000 if a Revolver Loan or a Term Loan that is a EurocurrencyTerm Reference Rate Loan or, in either case, a greater integral multiple of $100,000;

65

(iii)    all accrued interest on the principal amount so to be prepaid must also be paid in full on the date of payment;

(iv)    Borrower shall pay any related Funding Loss upon demand; and

(v)    unless a Default or Potential Default has occurred and is continuing (or would arise as a result thereof), any prepayment of the Revolver Principal Debt may be reborrowed by Borrower, subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan Papers.

Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a payment notice from Borrower, and of the amount of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of such prepayment.

(h)    Borrower may, upon notice to the applicable Swing Line Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans owed to such Swing Line Lender, in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided, that (i) such notice must be in a form acceptable to the applicable Swing Line Lender and be received by the applicable Swing Line Lender and Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon on the date of the prepayment, and (ii) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000, or a greater integral multiple thereof. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein[Reserved].

3.3    Interest Options.

Except where specifically otherwise provided, (a) Revolver Loans and Term Loans bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lesser of (a) (i) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin or Eurocurrencyfor Base Rate Loans, (ii) the Daily Simple SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Daily SOFR Rate Loans, (iii) the Term Reference Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Term Reference Rate Loans for the Interest Period, if any, selected by Borrower (in each case as designated or deemed designated by Borrower), as the case may be, and (ii) the Maximum Rate, and (b) Swing Line Loans bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lesser of (i) Daily Floating LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin and (iib) the Maximum Rate. Each change in the Base Rate, the Term Reference Rate, Daily Floating LIBORSimple SOFR, and the Maximum Rate is effective, without notice to Borrower or any other Person, upon the effective date of change.

3.4    Quotation of Rates.

A Responsible Officer of Borrower may call Administrative Agent before delivering a Loan Notice or Swing Line Loan Notice to receive an indication of the interest rates then in effect, but the indicated rates do not bind Administrative Agent or Lenders or affect the interest rate that is actually in effect when Borrower delivers its Loan Notice or Swing Line Loan Notice or on the Loan Date.

3.5    Default Rate.

While any Default exists, then upon the request of Required Lenders (except in the case of a Default resulting from the failure to pay Principal Debt when due, in which case, such increase shall be automatic), Borrower shall pay interest on the Principal Debt at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by Borrower under any Loan Paper is not paid when due (without
66

regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise, then upon the request of Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.

3.6    Interest Recapture.

If the designated interest rate applicable to any Loan exceeds the Maximum Rate, the interest rate on that Loan is limited to the Maximum Rate, but any subsequent reductions in the designated rate shall not reduce the interest rate thereon below the Maximum Rate until the total amount of accrued interest equals the amount of interest that would have accrued if that designated rate had always been in effect. If at maturity (stated or by acceleration), or at final payment of the Notes, the total interest paid or accrued is less than the interest that would have accrued if the designated rates had always been in effect, then, at that time and to the extent permitted by Law, Borrower shall pay an amount equal to the difference between (a) the lesser of the amount of interest that would have accrued if the designated rates had always been in effect and the amount of interest that would have accrued if the Maximum Rate had always been in effect, and (b) the amount of interest actually paid or accrued on the Notes.

3.7    Interest Calculations; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Margin.

(a)    All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days (even when those loans are determined by the LIBO RateTerm SOFR), as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 3.1(c), bear interest for one day.

(b)    If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of Borrower or for any other reason, Borrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the ratio of Net Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by Borrower pursuant to Section 11.1 as of any applicable date, was inaccurate, and (ii) a proper calculation thereof would have resulted in higher pricing and fees for such period, then Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or L/C Issuers, as the case may be, promptly on demand by Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to Borrower under Debtor Relief Law, automatically and without further action by Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 2.3(c)(iii), 5.3, or 3.3 or under Section 12. Borrower’s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Total Commitment and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.

3.8    Maximum Rate.

67

Regardless of any provision contained in any Loan Paper or any document related thereto, no Lender is entitled to contract for, charge, take, reserve, receive, or apply, as interest on all or any part of the Obligation any amount in excess of the Maximum Rate, and, if Lenders ever do so, then any excess shall be treated as a partial payment of principal and any remaining excess shall be refunded to Borrower. In determining if the interest paid or payable exceeds the Maximum Rate, Borrower and Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Law, (a) treat all Loans as but a single extension of credit (and Lenders and Borrower agree that is the case and that provision in this Agreement for multiple Loans is for convenience only), (b) characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee, or premium rather than as interest, (c) exclude voluntary payments and their effects, and (d) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligation. However, if the Obligation is paid in full before the end of its full contemplated term, and if the interest received for its actual period of existence exceeds the Maximum Amount, Lenders shall refund any excess (and Lenders shall not, to the extent permitted by Law, be subject to any penalties provided by any Laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving, or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Amount).

3.9    Interest Periods.

When Borrower requests any EurocurrencyTerm Reference Rate Loan, Borrower may elect the applicable Interest Period. No more than ten (10) EurocurrencyTerm Reference Rate Interest Periods may be in effect at one time.

3.10    Order of Application.

(a)    If no Default or Potential Default exists, payments, and prepayments of the Obligation shall be applied first to fees then due, second to accrued interest then due and payable on the Principal Debt, and then to the remaining Obligation in the order and manner as Borrower may direct.

(b)    If a Default or Potential Default exists, any payment or prepayment (including proceeds from the exercise of any Rights) shall be applied to the Obligation in the following order: (i) to the payment of all fees, expenses, and indemnities for which Administrative Agent has not been paid or reimbursed in accordance with the Loan Papers; (ii) to the ratable payment of all fees, expenses, and indemnities (other than L/C fees set forth in Section 5.3 hereof (collectively, “L/C Fees”)) for which Lenders have not been paid or reimbursed in accordance with the Loan Papers (as used in this clause (ii), a “ratable payment” for any Lender shall be, on any date of determination, that proportion which the portion of the total fees, expenses, and indemnities owed to such Lender bears to the total aggregate fees, expenses, and indemnities owed to all Lenders on such date of determination); (iii) to the ratable payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Principal Debt and L/C Fees (as used in this clause (iii), “ratable payment” means, for any Lender, on any date of determination, that proportion which the accrued and unpaid interest on the Principal Debt owed to such Lender bears to the total accrued and unpaid interest on the Principal Debt owed to all Lenders); (iv) to the ratable payment of the Principal Debt (as used in this clause (iv), “ratable payment” means for any Lender, on any date of determination, that proportion which the Principal Debt owed to such Lender bears to the Principal Debt owed to all Lenders); (v) to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Exposure comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of L/Cs; (vi) to the payment of the remaining Obligation in the order and manner Required Lenders deem appropriate; and (vii) the balance, if any, after all of the Obligation has been indefeasibly paid in full, to Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.
68


Subject to Section 2.3(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of L/Cs pursuant to clause (v) above shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such L/Cs as they occur. If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all L/Cs have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Obligation, if any, in the order set forth above.

Subject to the provisions of Section 14 and provided that Administrative Agent shall not in any event be bound to inquire into or to determine the validity, scope, or priority of any interest or entitlement of any Lender and may suspend all payments or seek appropriate relief (including, without limitation, instructions from Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders or Required Term Loan Lenders or an action in the nature of interpleader) in the event of any doubt or dispute as to any apportionment or distribution contemplated hereby, Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such amounts to each Lender in accordance with the Agreement and the related Loan Papers.

3.11    Payments Generally.

(a)    Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of Sections 2 or 3, and such funds are not made available to Borrower by Administrative Agent because the conditions set forth in Section 7 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

(b)    Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

3.12    Sharing of Payments, Etc.

If any Lender (a “Benefitted Lender”) shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of the Loans owing to it, or interest thereon, or receive any Collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or Collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender’s Loans owing to it, or interest thereon, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lender’s Loans owing to it, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such Collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such Collateral or proceeds ratably with each Lender; provided, however, that (i) if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 3.14 or (z) any payment obtained by a Revolver Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Exposure or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of
69

this Section shall apply). Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from a Lender pursuant to this Section 3.12 may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all of its Rights of payment (including the Right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Person were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.

3.13    Booking Loans.

To the extent permitted by Law, any Lender may make, carry, or transfer its Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of any of its Affiliates. However, no Affiliate is entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 4.3 than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to those Loans.

3.14    Cash Collateral.

(a)    Certain Credit Support Events. Upon the request of Administrative Agent (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any L/C and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the L/C Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of Administrative Agent, or the L/C Issuer, or the Swing Line Lender, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 3.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). If at any time Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than Administrative Agent or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L/C Exposure, Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay to Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited as Cash Collateral, an amount equal to the excess of (x) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (y) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any L/C for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Laws, to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer.

(b)    Grant of Security Interest. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America. Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, and the Lenders (including the Swing Line Lender), and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts, and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 3.14(c). If at any time Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay or provide to Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency or in the amount of such third party rights or claims to which the Cash Collateral is subject, as applicable.

70

(c)    Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 3.14, Section 2.3, Section 3.2, Section 3.15, or Section 13 in respect of L/C or Swing Line Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein.

(d)    Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 15.11(b)(vi))) or (ii) Administrative Agent’s and the L/C Issuers’ good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.

3.15    Defaulting Lenders.

(a)    Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:

(i)    Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver, or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 15.9 and in the definitions of “Required Lenders”, “Required Revolver Lenders” and “Required Term Loan Lenders”.

(ii)    Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees, or other amounts received by Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Sections 12 or 13 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 15.13), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by Administrative Agent or requested by the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Swing Line Loan or L/C; fourth, as Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Potential Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by Administrative Agent and Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, or the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, or the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that
71

Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Potential Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or L/C Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments, or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 3.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

(iii)    Certain Fees.

(A)    No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 5.4 for any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender).

(B)    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Fees for any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Commitment Percentage of the stated amount of all L/Cs for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 3.14.

(C)    With respect to any L/C Fees not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Borrowing or Swing Line Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the applicable L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuer’s or Swing Line Lender’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.

(iv)    Reallocation of Commitment Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance, or fund participations in L/Cs or Swing Line Loans pursuant to Sections 2.3 and 2.4, the “Commitment Percentage” of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided, that, the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance, or fund participations in L/Cs and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the excess, if any, of (1) the Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender over (2) the aggregate Outstanding Amount
72

of the Loans of that Lender. Subject to Section 15.24, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.

(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If Borrower, Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lenders and the L/C Issuers agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolver Loans and Term Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/Cs and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Commitment Percentages (without giving effect to Section 3.15(a)(iv)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.


73

SECTION 4    TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION, AND ILLEGALITY

4.1    Taxes.

(a)    Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes.

(i)    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Restricted Company under any Loan Paper shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by Administrative Agent or a Restricted Company, then Administrative Agent or such Restricted Company shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.

(ii)    If any Restricted Company or Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Restricted Company shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.1) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

(iii)    If any Restricted Company or Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such Restricted Company or Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) such Restricted Company or Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Restricted Company shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.1) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

(b)    Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Restricted Companies shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
74


(c)    Tax Indemnifications.

(i)    Each of the Restricted Companies shall, and does hereby, jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 4.1 payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender or an L/C Issuer (with a copy to Administrative Agent), or by Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each of the Restricted Companies shall, and does hereby, jointly and severally indemnify Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 4.1(c)(ii) below.

(ii)    Each Lender and each L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (x) Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or such L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that any Restricted Company has not already indemnified Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Restricted Companies to do so), (y) Administrative Agent and the Restricted Companies, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 15.11 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) Administrative Agent and the Restricted Companies, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in each case, that are payable or paid by Administrative Agent or a Restricted Company in connection with any Loan Paper, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper against any amount due to Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).

(d)    Evidence of Payments. Upon request by Borrower or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by Borrower or by Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 4.1, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent or Administrative Agent shall deliver to Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Borrower or Administrative Agent, as the case may be.

75

(e)    Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.

(i)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Paper shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as will enable Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 4.1(e)(ii)(A), 4.1(e)(ii)(B) and 4.1(e)(ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that Borrower is a U.S. Person,

(A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;

(B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

(I)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Paper, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Paper, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;

(II)    executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;

76

(III)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or

(IV)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;

(C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and

(D)    if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Paper would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

77

(iii)    Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 4.1 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the Closing Date, Borrower and Administrative Agent shall treat (and Lenders hereby authorize Administrative Agent to treat) this Agreement as not qualifying as a “grandfathered obligation” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).

(f)    Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or a L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or such L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Restricted Company or with respect to which any Restricted Company has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 4.1, it shall pay to the Restricted Company an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by a Restricted Company under this Section 4.1 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Restricted Company, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Restricted Company (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Restricted Company pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Restricted Company or any other Person.

(g)    Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 4.1 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

4.2    Illegality.

If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or make, maintain, or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR, Term SOFR, or Daily Simple SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon Eurocurrency RateSOFR, Term SOFR or Daily Floating LIBORSimple SOFR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender
78

to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank marketengage in reverse repurchase of U.S. Treasury securities transactions of the type included in the determination of SOFR, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to Borrower through Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrencyeither Term SOFR Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or to make Daily Floating LIBOR Loans, shall be suspendedDaily SOFR Rate Loans shall be suspended and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), prepay (without penalty or premium other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.5) or, if applicable, convert all EurocurrencyTerm SOFR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of Daily Floating LIBOR Loans, on the next Business Day for Eurocurrency Rate Loans), if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such EurocurrencyTerm SOFR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such EurocurrencyTerm SOFR Rate Loans, (ii) Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), immediately prepay or, if applicable, convert all Daily Floating LIBORSOFR Rate Loans, or participations in Swing Line Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), and (iii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR, Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to Term SOFR component thereof until Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 4.5.

4.3    Inability to Determine Rates.

(a)    If, in connection with any request for a EurocurrencyTerm SOFR Rate Loan or a Daily SOFR Rate Loan, or a conversion toof Daily SOFR Rate Loans to Term SOFR Rate Loans or a continuation thereofof any of such advances, as applicable, (ia) Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (Ai) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loanno Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 4.3(b), and the circumstances under Section 4.3(b)(i) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred, or (B) (xii) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed EurocurrencyTerm SOFR Rate Loan (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (iii) adequate and (y) the circumstances described in Section 4.3(c)(i) do not apply (in each case with respect to clause (i) above, “Impacted Loans”)reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Daily Simple SOFR in connection with an existing or proposed Daily SOFR Rate Loan, or (iib) Administrative Agent or
79

the Required Lenders determine that for any reason Eurocurrency Ratethat Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period or Daily Floating LIBORSimple SOFR with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loanadvance does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loanadvance, Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain EurocurrencyTerm SOFR Rate Loans, Daily SOFR Rate Loans, or to convert Daily SOFR Rate Loans to Term SOFR Rate Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected EurocurrencyTerm SOFR Rate Loans, Daily SOFR Rate Loans, or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to Eurocurrency Ratethe Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of Eurocurrency Ratethe Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by Required Lenders described in Section 4.3(b), until Administrative Agent upon the instruction of Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (1) Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Loanborrowing of, or conversion to, or continuation of EurocurrencyTerm SOFR Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected EurocurrencyTerm SOFR Rate Loans, Daily SOFR Rate Loans, or Interest Periods), or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause, (i2) of Section 4.3(a), Administrative Agent, in consultation with Borrower and the affected Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (i) Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impactedany outstanding Term SOFR Rate Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans under clause (i) ofimmediately at the first sentenceend of Section 4.3(a), (ii) Administrative Agent or the affected Lenders notify Administrative Agent and Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (iii) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or itstheir respective applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides Administrative Agent and Borrower written notice thereofInterest Period, and (3) any outstanding Daily SOFR Rate Loans shall immediately be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans.

(b)    (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Papers, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:

(i)    adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBO Rate for any Interest Period hereunder or any other tenorsone (1) month, three (3) month or six (6) month interest periods of LIBO RateTerm SOFR, including, without limitation, because the LIBORTerm SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or

80

(ii)    theCME or any successor administrator of the LIBORTerm SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBO Rateone (1) month, three (3) month or six (6) month interest periods of Term SOFR or the LIBORTerm SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of loansDollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide LIBO Ratesuch interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (such specificthe latest date on which one (1) month, three (3) month or six (6) month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”); or

(iii)    the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such administrator has made a public statement announcing that all Interest Periods and other tenors of LIBO Rate are no longer representative; or

(iv)    syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar to that contained in this Section 4.3, are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace LIBO Rate;

then, in the case of clauses (i)-(iii) above, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the “LIBORTerm SOFR Replacement Date”), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and shall occur reasonably promptly upon the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances under clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above and, solely with respect to clause (iib) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, LIBO RateTerm SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan PaperDocument with, subject to the proviso below, the first available alternative set forth in the order below Daily Simple SOFR for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan PaperDocument (the “LIBOR Successor Rate”; and any such rate before giving effect to the Related Adjustment, the “Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate”):.

(x) Term SOFR plus the Related Adjustment; and

(y) SOFR plus the Related Adjustment;

and in the case of clause (iv) above, the Borrower and Administrative Agent may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing LIBO Rate under this Agreement and under any other Loan Paper in accordance with the definition of “LIBOR Successor Rate” and such amendment will become effective at 5:00 p.m., on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have notified all Lenders and the Borrower of the occurrence of the circumstances described in clause (iv) above unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required
81

Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate pursuant to such clause;

provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines that Term SOFR has become available, is administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent and would have been identified as the Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate in accordance with the foregoing if it had been so available at the time that the LIBOR Successor Rate then in effect was so identified, and the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and each Lender of such availability, then from and after the beginning of the Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, in each case, commencing no less than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice, the Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate shall be Term SOFR and the LIBOR Successor Rate shall be Term SOFR plus the relevant Related Adjustment.

The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of (x) any occurrence of any of the events, periods or circumstances under clauses (i) through (iii) above, (y) a LIBOR Replacement Date and (z) the LIBOR Successor Rate.

Any LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent.

Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time (i) from the Fourth Amendment Closing Date through the end of the Temporary Waiver Period any LIBOR Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than 0.25%, the LIBOR Successor Rate will be deemed to be 0.25% for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, and (ii) at any other time any LIBOR Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than 0.00%, the LIBOR Successor Rate will be deemed to be 0.00 % for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Papers.

In connection with the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Paper, any amendments implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.

If the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 4.3(c)(i)-(iii) have occurred with respect to the LIBOR Successor Rate then in effect, then the successor rate thereto shall be determined in accordance with the definition of “LIBOR Successor Rate.”

If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on the last day of each calendar month.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) after any such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of any such notice described under Section 4.3(c)(i)-(iii), as applicable, if the Administrative
82

Agent determines that none of the LIBOR Successor RatesDaily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the LIBORTerm SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances described in Section 4.3(c)(iv) have occurred but none of the LIBOR Successor Rates is available, or (iii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 4.3(c)(i)-(iii)clauses (a) or (b) above have occurred with respect to Daily Simple SOFR or the LIBOR Successor Rate then in effect and the Administrative Agent determines that none of the LIBOR Successor Rates is available, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing LIBO Rate Term SOFR, Daily Simple SOFR, and/or any then current LIBOR Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 4.3 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with another alternatean alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollarDollar denominated syndicated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmarksbenchmark, and, in each case, including any Related Adjustments and any other mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollarDollar denominated syndicated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmarksbenchmark, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments, shall constitute a LIBOR “Successor Rate”. Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.

(e)    If, at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with clauses (c) or (d) of this Section 4.3(c) and the circumstances under clauses (c)(i) or (c)(iii) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the

Administrative Agent will promptly so(in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency

Any Successor Rate Loans shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans, Interest Periods, interest payment dates or payment periods), and (y) the Eurocurrencyapplied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate component shall no longer be utilizedapplied in determining the Base Rate, until the LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with clauses (c) or (d) of this Section. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans, Interest Periods, interest payment dates or payment periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of Base Rate Loans (subject to the
83

foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified thereina manner as otherwise reasonably determined by Administrative Agent.

Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than 0.00%, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be 0.00 % for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Papers.

In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.

4.4    Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans.

(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:

(i)    impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge, or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with, or for the account of, or credit extended, or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 4.4(e)) or the L/C Issuers;

(ii)    subject any Lender or any L/C Issuer to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or

(iii)    impose on any Lender or any L/C Issuer or the Londonany interbank market any other condition, cost, or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any L/C or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing, or maintaining any L/C (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any L/C), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest, or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b)    Capital Requirements. If any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or the applicable L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
84

Lender’s or the applicable L/C Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the applicable L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in L/Cs held by, such Lender, or the L/Cs issued by the applicable L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or the applicable L/C Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the applicable L/C Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or the applicable L/C Issuer’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time, upon demand of such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer, Borrower will pay to such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount as will compensate such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or the applicable L/C Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c)    Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or any L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

(d)    Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or either L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the applicable L/C Issuer’s right to demand such compensation, provided, that that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or the applicable L/C Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

(e)    Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; provided, that Borrower shall have received at least 10 days prior notice (with a copy to Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the last day of the relevant Interest Period, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.

4.5    Compensation for Losses.

Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent) from time to time, Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost, or expense incurred by it as a result of:

85

(a)    any continuation, conversion, payment, or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loanbearing interest at Term SOFR on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

(b) any failure by Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loanan advance at Term SOFR) to prepay, borrow, continue, or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by Borrower;

(c) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate LoanLoans bearing interest at Term SOFR on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by Borrower pursuant to Section 15.14; or

(d) any failure by Borrower to make payment of any Loan or of any drawing under any L/C (or interest due thereon) denominated in the Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan bearing interest at Term SOFR or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating

The amounts payable by Borrower to Lenders under this Section 4.5, each Lender shall never be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrencyless than zero or greater than is permitted by applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, no amounts will be owing under this Section in connection with the prepayment of any Daily SOFR Rate Loan made by it at Eurocurrencyor Base Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded(if any).

4.6    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 4.4, or Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 4.1, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 4.2, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches, or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.4, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 4.2, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 4.4, or if Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
86

Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 4.1, Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 15.14.

If there is any change in the Applicable Margin during any quarter, the actual daily amount of each standby L/C shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Margin separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Margin was in effect.

(b) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuers. Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer, for its own account, a fronting fee in an amount specified in the applicable Fee Letter executed by Borrower and such L/C Issuer, or such
87

other amount as may be agreed upon by Borrower and such L/C Issuer, or, with respect to commercial L/Cs, in an amount agreed upon by Borrower and such L/C Issuers. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable (i) with respect to standby L/Cs, on the tenth Business Day after the end of each January, April, July, and October in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such L/C, on the L/C Expiration Date, and thereafter on demand, or (ii) with respect to commercial L/Cs, upon the issuance thereof and with respect to any amendment increasing the amount of such commercial L/C, on the amount of such increase, and payable upon the effectiveness of such amendment. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any L/C, the amount of such L/C shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.7. In addition, Borrower shall pay directly to the applicable L/C Issuer for its own account, in Dollars the customary issuance, presentation, amendment, and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears on the basis of the actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) in a calendar year of 360 days, and if there is any change in the Applicable Percentage during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Percentage separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Percentage was in effect.

7.2    Each Loan.

The obligation of each Lender to make any Loan (other than a conversion of Loans to the other Type or a continuation of Revolver Loans as EurocurrencyTerm Reference Rate Loans) is subject to the following conditions precedent: (a) Administrative Agent shall have timely received a Loan Notice (or in the case of a Swing Line Loan, a Swing Line Loan Notice) or the applicable L/C Issuer shall have timely received the applicable L/C Agreement; (b) the applicable L/C Issuer shall have received any applicable L/C fee; (c) all of the representations and warranties of the Companies in the Loan Papers are true and correct in all material respects (unless they speak to a specific date or are based on facts which have changed by transactions contemplated or permitted by this Agreement); (d) no Material Adverse Event, Default or Potential Default exists or would result from the proposed funding of such Loans or issuance of L/Cs; and (e) the funding of the Loans or issuance of the L/Cs is permitted by Law. Upon Administrative Agent’s reasonable request, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent evidence substantiating any of the matters in the Loan Papers that are necessary to enable Borrower to qualify for the Loans or L/Cs. Each condition precedent in this Agreement is material to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and time is of the essence with respect to each condition precedent. Subject to the prior approval of Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders or Required Term Loan Lenders, as the case may be, Lenders may fund any Loan, and the applicable L/C Issuer may issue any L/C, without all conditions being satisfied, but, to the extent permitted by Law, that funding and issuance shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the requirement that each condition precedent be satisfied as a prerequisite for any subsequent funding or issuance, unless Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders or Required Term Loan Lenders, as applicable, specifically waive each item in writing. Each Loan Notice (other than a Loan Notice requesting only a conversion of Loans to the other Type or a continuation as EurocurrencyTerm Reference Rate Loans), each Swing Line Loan Notice, and each L/C Agreement submitted by Borrower shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty that the conditions specified in this Section 7.2 have been satisfied on and as of the date of the applicable Loan or issuance of the applicable L/C. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 7.2, Lenders will not be obligated to honor any Loan Notice (including a Loan Notice converting Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrencyor Daily SOFR Rate Loans to Term Reference Rate Loans or continuing EurocurrencyTerm Reference Rate Loans) or Swing Line Loan Notice if a Default or Potential Default
91

exists or would result after giving effect to the proposed funding, conversion, or continuation of such Loans or issuance of L/Cs. In the case of a Loan to be denominated in an Alternative Currency, there shall not have occurred any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Required Term Loan Lenders (in the case of any Term Loans to be denominated in an Alternative Currency) or the L/C Issuer (in the case of any L/C to be denominated in an Alternative Currency) would make it impracticable for such Loan to be denominated in the relevant Alternative Currency.

SECTION 8    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

Borrower (and each Guarantor by execution of a Guaranty) represents and warrants to Administrative Agent and Lenders as set forth below; provided however, that representations and warranties of any such Guarantor shall be made solely as to such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries:

8.1    Regulation U.
No Company is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any “margin stock” within the meaning of Regulations U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended.

Following the application of the proceeds of each Loan, each L/C Borrowing, or each drawing under each L/C, not more than 25% of the value of the assets (either of Borrower only or the Companies on a consolidated basis) subject to the provisions of Section 10.5, Section 10.10, and Section 10.11 or subject to any restriction contained in any agreement or instrument between Borrower and any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender relating to Debt and within the scope of Section 12.8 will be margin stock.

Except where failure is not a Material Adverse Event, each Restricted Company (a) is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction where the nature and extent of its business and properties require due qualification and good standing as identified on Schedule 8.2 (or any such revised Schedule 8.2), and (b) possesses all requisite authority, permits, licenses, consents, approvals, and power to (i) own or lease its assets and conduct its business as is now being, or is contemplated by this Agreement to be, conducted, and (ii) execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under the Loan Papers to which it is party.

All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Restricted Companies other than VRI are owned of record and beneficially as set forth thereon, free and clear of any Liens, restrictions, claims, or Rights of another Person, other than Permitted
92

Liens, and are not subject to any warrant, option, or other acquisition Right of any Person or subject to any transfer restriction, other than restrictions imposed by securities Laws and general corporate Laws. All Unrestricted Subsidiaries meet the requirements of “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” as set forth in the definition thereof. All Unrestricted Subsidiaries that are being re-designated as “Restricted Subsidiaries” on the Closing Date are in compliance with Section 9.11(b) as of the Closing Date.

8.5    Binding Effect.

Upon execution and delivery by all parties thereto, each Loan Paper which is a contract will constitute a legal and binding obligation of each Restricted Company party thereto, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable Debtor Relief Laws and general principles of equity.

8.6    Financial Statements.

8.7    Litigation.

Except as disclosed on Schedule 8.7, (a) no Company (other than as a creditor or claimant) is subject to, or aware of the threat of, any Litigation (i) that is reasonably likely to be determined adversely to any Company and, if so adversely determined, shall result in a Material Adverse Event, or (ii) that purports to affect or pertain to this Agreement or any other Loan Paper, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) no outstanding or unpaid judgments against any Company exist, and (c) no Company is a party to, or bound by, any judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or consent decree relating to any past or present practice, omission, activity, or undertaking which constitutes a Material Adverse Event.

(b)    Except for Permitted Liens, no Lien exists on any property of any Company (including, without limitation, the Forest Service Permits and the Water Rights), and the execution, delivery, performance, or observance of the Loan Papers will not require or result in the creation of any Lien on any Company’s property.

10.21 Temporary Waiver Period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, so long as the Temporary Waiver Period is continuing, the following provisions will apply:

(a) Borrower agrees to comply, and cause each Company to comply, with the following:

(i)    [Reserved];

(ii)    The Restricted Companies shall maintain Availability and Unrestricted Cash, on the last day of each month, in an aggregate amount of not less than $150,000,000;

(iii)    No Restricted Company will incur Secured Debt which when added to the aggregate existing Secured Debt and Availability is in excess of $1,750,000,000, and any Secured Debt, other than Loans and L/Cs Borrowings, shall be subject to an intercreditor agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent;

(iv) VRI will not make any Distributions unless (A) no Default or Potential Default exists or arises after giving effect to such Distribution, (B) the Restricted Companies have Availability and Unrestricted Cash in an aggregate amount of at least $300,000,000 immediately after giving effect to such Distribution (as evidenced by a certificate delivered by the Borrower to Administrative Agent in the form of Exhibit H attached hereto) and (C) such Distributions do not exceed $38,200,000 in the aggregate per fiscal quarter;

(v)    No Company will make or suffer to exist any loan, advance, extension of credit or capital contribution to, make any investment in, purchase or commit to purchase any stock or other securities or evidences of Debt of, or interests in, any other Person, or Permitted Recourse Obligations constituting Debt pursuant to Section 10.8(l), (m), (t) or (v) of this Agreement, unless the Restricted Companies have Availability and Unrestricted Cash in an aggregate amount of at least $300,000,000 immediately after giving effect to such transaction (as evidenced by a certificate delivered by the Borrower to Administrative Agent in the form of Exhibit H attached hereto);

(vi)    [Reserved];

(vii)    Borrower shall apply the net cash proceeds received from the sale, assignment, lease, transfer or other disposition of a Restricted Company’s assets with a fair market value in excess of $15,000,000 towards repayment of the Revolver Principal Debt or the Term Revolver Principal Debt, as directed by Borrower; and

(b)    On the Third Amendment Closing Date, in order to accommodate the establishment of differing rate floors for the portion of any Term Loans for which Borrower has entered into Financial Hedges for purposes of hedging its exposure to fluctuations in the Eurocurrency Rate and the portion of any Term Loans for which Borrower has not entered into Financial Hedges for purposes of hedging its exposure to fluctuations in the Eurocurrency Rate, the Term Loans will be split into the Term Hedged Tranche and the Term Unhedged Tranche. Each Term Loan Lender will hold each of the Term Hedged
114

Tranche and the Term Unhedged Tranche ratably in accordance with such Term Loan Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the Term Loan Facility, as set forth on Schedule 1-A on the Third Amendment Closing Date (as the same may be updated from time to time by Administrative Agent after receipt of a Hedge Change Notice). Other than with respect to the differing rate floors during the Temporary Waiver Period, the Interest Periods and all other payment and interest terms applicable to the Term Loans will be applicable to the Term Hedged Tranche and the Term Unhedged Tranche. Borrower will provide Administrative Agent notice within five Business Days after any change in the amount of Term Loans for which Borrower has entered into Financial Hedges (a “Hedge Change Notice”). Administrative Agent will then adjust the Register and Schedule 1-A in the amount of the Term Hedged Tranche and the Term Unhedged Tranche in accordance with such notice as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within ten Business Days of receipt of a Hedge Change Notice. If, as a result of Borrower’s failure to deliver a Hedge Change Notice to Administrative Agent for any reason, Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that a delivery of a Hedge Change Notice would have resulted in higher pricing for such period as a result of a higher interest rate floor, Borrower shall, retroactively to the date that the Hedge Change Notice should have been delivered, be obligated to pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the Term Loan Lenders promptly on demand by Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by Administrative Agent or any Term Loan Lender), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. As soon as administratively feasible, but in any event with ten Business Days, after the termination of the Temporary Waiver Period, the Administrative Agent will combine the Term Hedged Tranche and the Term Unhedged Tranche such that the multiple tranches of Term Loans no longer exist.

Borrower shall calculate each such ratio after giving effect to the provisions of Section 1.3 hereof.

11.1    Maximum Leverage Ratio.

As calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Restricted Companies set forth below, the Restricted Companies shall not permit the ratio of (a) the unpaid principal amount of Net Funded Debt existing as of such last day to (b) Adjusted EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters ending on such last day to exceed 6.25 to 1.00 for the first full fiscal quarter ending after the expiration of the Temporary Waiver Period and for each fiscal quarter thereafter.

115

interest expense under GAAP and paid in cash during the applicable period) in such four fiscal quarters to be less than 2.00 to 1.00.

11.3    Senior Secured Leverage Ratio.

As calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Restricted Companies, the Restricted Companies shall not permit the ratio of (a) the unpaid principal amount of outstanding secured Net Funded Debt existing as of such last day to (b) Adjusted EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters ending on such last day to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 for the first full fiscal quarter ending after the expiration of the Temporary Waiver Period and for each fiscal quarter thereafter.

Except where the occurrence or existence, individually or in the aggregate, is not a Material Adverse Event or, in any event, likely to result in a Lien on the assets of any Company or the Companies securing liability for any Company or the Companies (individually or when aggregated with any liability of the Companies contemplated by Section 8.8 and Section 8.9 herein that is reasonably likely to be secured by Liens) in excess of the Threshold Amount, (a) an Employee Plan or Multiemployer Plan, as applicable, has any “unpaid minimum required contribution” (as described in section 4971(c)(4) of the Code), whether or not waived, or any “accumulated funding deficiency” (as defined in section 302 of ERISA or section 412 of the Code), (b) a Company or an ERISA Affiliate incurs liability under ERISA to the PBGC in connection with any Employee Plan (other than required insurance premiums paid when due), (c) a Company or an ERISA Affiliate withdraws in whole or in part from participation in a Multiemployer Plan, (d) a Company, an ERISA Affiliate, or a Multiemployer Plan to which a Company or any ERISA Affiliate contributes to or has contributed to, receives notice concerning the determination that the Multiemployer Plan is, or is expected to be, insolvent or in reorganization, within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA, (e) a Company or an ERISA Affiliate engages in any “prohibited transaction” (as defined in section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code), or (f) a “reportable event” (as defined in section 4043 of ERISA) occurs with respect to an Employee Plan, excluding events for which the notice requirement is waived under applicable PBGC regulations.

SECTION 13    RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

13.1    Remedies Upon Default.

(a) If a Default exists under Section 12.3, the commitment to extend credit under this Agreement automatically terminates, the entire unpaid balance of the Obligation automatically becomes due and payable without any action of any kind whatsoever, and Borrower must provide cash collateral in an amount equal to the then-existing L/C Exposure.

(b) If any Default exists, subject to the terms of Section 14.5, Administrative Agent may (with the consent of, and must, upon the request of, Required Lenders), do any one or more of the following: (i) if the maturity of the Obligation has not already been accelerated under Section 13.1(a), declare the entire unpaid balance of all or any part of the Obligation immediately due and payable, whereupon it is due and payable; (ii) terminate the Commitments of Lenders; (iii) reduce any claim to judgment; (iv)
118

demand Borrower to provide cash collateral in an amount equal to the L/C Exposure then existing; and (v) exercise any and all other legal or equitable Rights afforded by the Loan Papers, the Laws of the State of New York, or any other applicable jurisdiction.

13.2    Company Waivers.

To the extent permitted by Law, each Company waives presentment and demand for payment, protest, notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration and notice of protest and nonpayment, and agrees that its liability with respect to all or any part of the Obligation is not affected by any renewal or extension in the time of payment of all or any part of the Obligation, by any indulgence, or by any release or change in any security for the payment of all or any part of the Obligation.

13.3    Performance by Administrative Agent.

If any covenant, duty, or agreement of any Company is not performed in accordance with the terms of the Loan Papers, Administrative Agent may, while a Default exists, at its option (but subject to the approval of Required Lenders), perform, or attempt to perform that covenant, duty, or agreement on behalf of that Company (and any amount expended by Administrative Agent in its performance or attempted performance is payable by the Companies, jointly and severally, to Administrative Agent on demand, becomes part of the Obligation, and bears interest at the Default Rate from the date of Administrative Agent’s expenditure until paid). However, Administrative Agent does not assume and shall never have, except by its express written consent, any liability or responsibility for the performance of any covenant, duty, or agreement of any Company.

13.4    Not in Control.

None of the covenants or other provisions contained in any Loan Paper shall, or shall be deemed to, give Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, or Lenders the Right to exercise control over the assets (including, without limitation, real property), affairs, or management of any Company; the power of Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, and Lenders is limited to the Right to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 13.

13.5    Course of Dealing.

The acceptance by Administrative Agent or Lenders of any partial payment on the Obligation shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any Default then existing. No waiver by Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders, Required Term Loan Lenders or Lenders of any Default shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other then-existing or subsequent Default. No delay or omission by Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders, Required Term Loan Lenders or Lenders in exercising any Right under the Loan Papers will impair that Right or be construed as a waiver thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any Right preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other Right under the Loan Papers or otherwise.

13.6    Cumulative Rights.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, all Rights available to Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders, Required Term Loan Lenders and
119

Lenders under the Loan Papers are cumulative of and in addition to all other Rights granted to Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders, Required Term Loan Lenders and Lenders at Law or in equity, whether or not the Obligation is due and payable and whether or not Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders, Required Term Loan Lenders or Lenders have instituted any suit for collection, foreclosure, or other action in connection with the Loan Papers.

13.7    Enforcement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Paper, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Papers against the Companies or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 13.1 for the benefit of all the Lenders and the L/C Issuers; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Papers, (b) the L/C Issuers or the Swing Line Lenders from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be) hereunder and under the other Loan Paper, (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 15.13 (subject to the terms of Section 3.12), or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Company under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Paper, then (i) Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 13.1 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c), and (d) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 3.12, any Lender may, with the consent of Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by Required Lenders.

13.8    Application of Proceeds.

Any and all proceeds ever received by Administrative Agent or Lenders from the exercise of any Rights pertaining to the Obligation shall be applied to the Obligation according to Section 3.10.

13.9    Diminution in Value of Collateral.

Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any liability or responsibility whatsoever for any diminution in or loss of value of any Collateral or other collateral ever securing payment or performance of all or any part of the Obligation (other than diminution in or loss of value caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct).

13.10    Certain Proceedings.

The Companies will promptly execute and deliver, or cause the execution and delivery of, all applications, certificates, instruments, registration statements and all other documents and papers Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders, Required Term Loan Lenders or Lenders reasonably request in connection with the obtaining of any consent, approval, registration, qualification, permit, license, or authorization of any Governmental Authority or other Person necessary or appropriate for the effective exercise of any Rights under the Loan Papers. Because Borrower agrees that Administrative Agent’s, the L/C Issuers’, Required Lenders’, Required Revolver
120

Lenders’, Required Term Loan Lenders’ and Lenders’ remedies at Law for failure of the Companies to comply with the provisions of this paragraph would be inadequate and that failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, Borrower agrees that the covenants of this paragraph may be specifically enforced.

SECTION 14    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

14.1    Appointment and Authority.

Each Lender and each L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Papers and authorizes Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of Administrative Agent, Lenders, and the L/C Issuers, and neither Borrower nor any other Company have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Papers (or any other similar term) with reference to Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.

14.2    Delegation of Duties.

Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Paper by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed in good faith by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub‑agent and to the Related Parties of Administrative Agent and any such sub‑agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.

14.3    Rights as a Lender.

The Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to Lenders. Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Restricted Company or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Restricted Company or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.
121


14.4    Reliance by Administrative Agent.

Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document, or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet, or intranet website posting, or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent, or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of an L/C, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such L/C. Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Borrower), independent accountants, and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants, or experts.

14.5    Exculpatory Provisions.

Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Papers, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent:

(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Potential Default has occurred and is continuing;

(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Papers that Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders or Required Term Loan Lenders, as applicable (or such other number or percentage of Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Papers), provided, that Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Paper or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and

(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Papers, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of Required Lenders, Required Revolver Lenders or Required Term Loan Lenders, as applicable (or such other number or percentage of Lenders as shall be necessary, or as Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 15.9 and 13.1), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. Administrative
122

Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Potential Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Potential Default is given to Administrative Agent by Borrower, a Lender, or an L/C Issuer.

Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty, or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Paper, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report, or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements, or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Potential Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness, or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Paper, or any other agreement, instrument, or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 7 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to Administrative Agent.

14.6    Resignation or Removal as Administrative Agent.

(a)    Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to Lenders, the L/C Issuers, and Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States, and shall be consented to by Borrower at all times other than during the existence of a Default or Potential Default (which consent of Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld). If no such successor shall have been so appointed by Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may, after consultation with Borrower, on behalf of Lenders and the L/C Issuers, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided, that if Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice.

(b)    If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in consultation with Borrower, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.

(c)    With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Papers (except that in the case of any collateral security held by Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders or the L/C Issuers under any of the Loan Papers, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent or collateral agent is appointed), and (2) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications, and determinations provided to be made by, to, or through Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the applicable L/C Issuer directly, until such time as Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become
123

vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges, and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 4.1(g) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Papers (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Papers, the provisions of this Section 14 and Section 15.4 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents, and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender. If Bank of America resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all L/Cs outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans, Daily SOFR Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.3(c). If Bank of America resigns as a Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of a Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.4(c). Upon the appointment by Borrower of a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder (which successor shall in all cases be a Lender other than a Defaulting Lender), (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges, and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, (b) the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Papers, and (c) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the L/Cs, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such L/Cs.

14.7    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.

Each Lender and each L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Paper, or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

14.8    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.

In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Restricted Company, Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Exposure shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by
124

declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

(a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Exposure, and all other Obligation that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of Lenders and Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements, and advances of Lenders and Administrative Agent, and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due Lenders, Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuers, as applicable, under Sections 5.3, 5.4, and 15.4) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

(b)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator, or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to Administrative Agent and, in the event that Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to Lenders, to pay to Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements, and advances of Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due Administrative Agent under Sections 5.4 and 15.4.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligation or the rights of any Lender or to authorize Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

14.9    Collateral and Guaranty Matters.

(a)    Upon the occurrence and continuance of a Default, Lenders agree to promptly confer in order that Required Lenders or Lenders, as the case may be, may agree upon a course of action for the enforcement of the Rights of Lenders; and Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action (without incurring any liability to any Person for so refraining) unless and until Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from Required Lenders. All Rights of action under the Loan Papers and all Rights to the Collateral, if any, hereunder may be enforced by Administrative Agent and any suit or proceeding instituted by Administrative Agent in furtherance of such enforcement shall be brought in its name as Administrative Agent without the necessity of joining as plaintiffs or defendants any other Lender, and the recovery of any judgment shall be for the benefit of Lenders subject to the expenses of Administrative Agent. In actions with respect to any property of any Restricted Company, Administrative Agent is acting for the ratable benefit of each Lender. Any and all agreements to subordinate (whether made heretofore or hereafter) other indebtedness or obligations of any Restricted Company to the Obligation shall be construed as being for the ratable benefit of each Lender.

(b)    Each Lender authorizes and directs Administrative Agent to enter into the Security Documents for the benefit of Lenders. Except to the extent unanimity is required hereunder, (i) each Lender agrees that any action taken by Required Lenders in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Papers, and the exercise by Required Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all Lenders, (ii) each Revolver Lender agrees that any action taken by Required Revolver Lenders in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Papers, and the exercise by Required Revolver Lenders of the powers set forth
125

herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all Revolver Lenders, and (iii) each Term Loan Lender agrees that any action taken by Required Term Loan Lenders in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Papers, and the exercise by Required Term Loan Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all Term Loan Lenders.

(c)    Administrative Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of all Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from any Lender, from time to time to take any action with respect to any Collateral or Security Documents which may be necessary to perfect and maintain perfected the Liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to the Security Documents.

(d)    Administrative Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any Lender or to any other Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Restricted Company or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered or that the Liens granted to Administrative Agent herein or pursuant hereto have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or enforced, or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure, or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the Rights granted or available to Administrative Agent in this Section 14.9 or in any of the Security Documents; it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, Administrative Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, given Administrative Agent’s own interest in the Collateral as one of Lenders and that Administrative Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever to any Lender, other than to act without gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(e)    Lenders irrevocably authorize Administrative Agent (or in the case of Bond Rights, the L/C Issuers), at its option and in its discretion, (i) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by Administrative Agent under any Loan Paper (A) upon termination of the Total Commitment and payment in full of all Obligation (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and the expiration or termination of all L/Cs, (B) as permitted under Section 9.11, (C) constituting property being sold or disposed of as permitted under Section 10.10, if Administrative Agent determines that the property being sold or disposed is being sold or disposed in accordance with the requirements and limitations of Section 10.10 and Administrative Agent concurrently receives all mandatory prepayments with respect thereto, if any, or (D) if approved, authorized, or ratified in writing by Required Lenders, subject to Section 15.9, unless such Liens are held under any Bond Document; (ii) to release (or authorize the release by the applicable L/C Issuer of) any Collateral held by Administrative Agent (or the applicable L/C Issuer) under or pursuant to any Bond Document upon the reimbursement of any Bond Purchase Drawing in accordance with Section 2.3(i) herein; and (iii) to release any Restricted Company from its Guaranty (A) upon full payment of the Obligation, (B) as permitted under Section 9.11, (C) in connection with the sale of disposition of the stock (or other equity interest) issued by such Restricted Company permitted under Section 10.10, if Administrative Agent determines that the disposition or sale is in accordance with the requirements and limitations of Section 10.10 and Administrative Agent concurrently receives all mandatory prepayments with respect thereto, if any, or (D) if approved, authorized, or ratified in writing by Required Lenders, subject to Section 15.9. Upon request by Administrative Agent at any time, Required Lenders will confirm in writing Administrative Agent’s authority to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 14.9.

(f)    In furtherance of the authorizations set forth in this Section 14.9, each Lender and each L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints Administrative Agent its attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, for and on behalf of and in the name of each such Lender and each such L/C Issuer, (i) to enter into Security Documents (including, without limitation, any appointments of substitute trustees
126

under any Security Document), (ii) to take action with respect to the Collateral and Security Documents to perfect, maintain, and preserve Lenders’ and the L/C Issuers’ Liens, as applicable, and (iii) to execute instruments of release or to take other action necessary to release Liens upon any Collateral to the extent authorized in clause (e) hereof. This power of attorney shall be liberally, not restrictively, construed so as to give the greatest latitude to Administrative Agent’s power, as attorney, relative to the Collateral matters described in this Section 14.9. The powers and authorities herein conferred on Administrative Agent may be exercised by Administrative Agent through any Person who, at the time of the execution of a particular instrument, is an officer of Administrative Agent. The power of attorney conferred by this Section 14.9(f) is granted for valuable consideration and is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable so long as the Obligation, or any part thereof, shall remain unpaid, Lenders are obligated to make any Loans, or the L/C Issuers are obligated to issue L/Cs, under the Loan Papers.

14.10    Financial Hedges

To the extent any Lender or any Affiliate of a Lender issues a Financial Hedge in accordance with the requirements of the Loan Papers and accepts the benefits of the Liens in the Collateral arising pursuant to the Security Documents, such Lender (for itself and on behalf of any such Affiliates) agrees (a) to appoint Administrative Agent, as its nominee and agent, to act for and on behalf of such Lender or Affiliate thereof in connection with the Security Documents and (b) to be bound by the terms of this Section 14; whereupon all references to “Lender” in this Section 14 and in the Security Documents shall include, on any date of determination, any Lender or Affiliate of a Lender that is party to a then-effective Financial Hedge which complies with the requirements of the Loan Papers. Additionally, if the Obligation owed to any Lender or Affiliate of a Lender consists solely of Debt arising under a Financial Hedge (such Lender or Affiliate being referred to in this Section 14.10 as an “Issuing Lender”), then such Issuing Lender (by accepting the benefits of any Security Documents) acknowledges and agrees that pursuant to the Loan Papers and without notice to or consent of such Issuing Lender: (w) Liens in the Collateral may be released in whole or in part; (x) all Guaranties may be released; (y) any Security Document may be amended, modified, supplemented, or restated; and (z) all or any part of the Collateral may be permitted to secure other Debt.

14.11    Bond L/Cs and Bond Documents.

In addition to the authorizations set forth in Section 14.9, each Lender and each L/C Issuer hereby authorize Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, to execute and deliver all certificates, documents, agreements, and instruments required to be delivered after the Closing Date pursuant to or in connection with any Bond L/C and Bond Documents executed in connection therewith, and to take such actions as Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, deems necessary in connection therewith. This authorization shall be liberally, not restrictively, construed so as to give the greatest latitude to Administrative Agent’s or the applicable L/C Issuer’s authority, as the case may be, relative to the Bonds, Bond L/Cs, and Bond Documents. The powers and authorities herein conferred on Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuers may be exercised by Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, through any Person who, at the time of the execution of a particular instrument, is an officer of Administrative Agent or such L/C Issuer, as applicable.

14.12    No Other Duties, Etc.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the co-syndication agents, co-documentation agents, joint lead arrangers, or joint bookrunners listed on the cover page hereof shall have
127

any powers, duties, or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Papers, except in its capacity, as applicable, as Administrative Agent, a Lender, or an L/C Issuer hereunder.

14.13    Recovery of Erroneous Payments.

Without limitation of any other provision in this Agreement, if at any time Administrative Agent makes a payment hereunder in error to any Lender or any L/C Issuer (the “Credit Party”), whether or not in respect of an Obligation due and owing by Borrower at such time, where such payment is a Rescindable Amount, then in any such event, each Credit Party receiving a Rescindable Amount severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount received by such Credit Party in immediately available funds in the currency so received, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such Rescindable Amount is received by it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. Each Credit Party irrevocably waives any and all defenses, including any “discharge for value” (under which a creditor might otherwise claim a right to retain funds mistakenly paid by a third party in respect of a debt owed by another) or similar defense to its obligation to return any Rescindable Amount. Administrative Agent shall inform each Credit Party promptly upon determining that any payment made to such Credit Party comprised, in whole or in part, a Rescindable Amount.

Any payment or action that is due under any Loan Paper on a non-Business Day may be delayed until the next-succeeding Business Day (but interest shall continue to accrue on any applicable payment until payment is in fact made) unless the payment concerns a EurocurrencyTerm Reference Rate Loan, in which case if the next-succeeding Business Day is in the next calendar month, then such payment shall be made on the next-preceding Business Day.

Administrative Agent or Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided, that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.

In no event shall Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the “Agent Parties”) have any liability to Borrower, any Lender, either L/C Issuer, or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract, or otherwise) arising out of Borrower’s or Administrative Agent’s transmission of Borrower Materials or notices through the Platform, any other electronic platform or electronic messaging service, or through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses are
129

determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to Borrower, any Lender, either L/C Issuer, or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).

(i)    Minimum Amounts.

(A)    in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and

(B)    in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.

136

(ii)    Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of the Swing Line Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of Swing Line Loans;

(iii)    Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:

(B)    the consent of Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; and

(C)    the consent of each L/C Issuer and each Swing Line Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required only for assignments of Commitments in respect of Revolver Loans and L/C Exposure.

(iv)    Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

(v)    No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to Borrower or any of Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural Person.

(vi)    Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of Borrower and Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and
137

participations in L/C and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

(vii) Assignments During Temporary Waiver Period. During the Temporary Waiver Period and until the Term Hedged Tranche and the Term Unhedged Tranche have been combined by Administrative Agent, any assignment by a Term Loan Lender to one or more Eligible Assignees in accordance with this Section 15.11 of all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the Term Loans shall be made pro rata across the Term Hedged Tranche and the Term Unhedged Tranche.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.5, and 15.4 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

(c) Register. Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Exposure owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, Borrower or Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender, Borrower, or any of Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender’s participations in L/C Exposure and Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided, that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain
138

unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) Borrower, Administrative Agent, Lenders, and the L/C Issuers shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Sections 15.4 without regard to the existence of any participation. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 15.9 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.1, 4.4, or 4.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 4.1(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 4.6 and 15.14 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 4.1 or 4.4, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.6 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 15.13 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.12 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Papers (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Paper) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103‑1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

(e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank; provided, that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

(f) Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time any L/C Issuer or any Swing Line Lender assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, such L/C Issuer or such Swing Line Lender may, upon 30 days’ notice to Borrower and Lenders, resign as an L/C Issuer or a Swing Line Lender, or both. In the event of any such resignation as an L/C Issuer or a Swing Line Lender, Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder;
139

provided, however, that no failure by Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of such L/C Issuer or such Swing Line Lender. If an L/C Issuer resigns, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges, and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all L/C outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Exposure with respect thereto (including the right to require Lenders to make Base Rate Loans, Daily SOFR Rate Loans or fund risk participations in unreimbursed amounts pursuant to Section 2.3(c)). If a Swing Line Lender resigns, it shall retain all the rights of a Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.4(c). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges, and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the L/Cs, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the resigning L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of such resigning L/C Issuer with respect to such L/Cs.

15.12    Payments Set Aside.

To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of Borrower or any other obligor on the Obligation under any Loan Paper is made to Administrative Agent, either L/C Issuer, or any Lender, or Administrative Agent, either L/C Issuer, or any Lender exercises its Right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by Administrative Agent, such L/C Issuer, or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and each L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of Lenders and the L/C Issuers under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligation and the termination of this Agreement.

15.13    Right of Setoff.

If a Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuers, and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, the applicable L/C Issuer, or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of Borrower or any other Company against any and all of the obligations of Borrower or such other Company now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper to such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper and although such obligations of Borrower or such other Company may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or the applicable L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, each L/C Issuer, and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
140

that such Lender, the applicable L/C Issuer, or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer agrees to notify Borrower and Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

15.14    Replacement of Lenders.

Under any circumstances set forth in this Agreement providing that Borrower shall have the right to replace a Lender as a party to this Agreement, including, without limitation, if any Lender requests compensation under Section 4.4, or if Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 4.1, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 15.11), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.4), and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Papers to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided, that:

(a) Borrower shall have paid to Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 15.11(b);

(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in L/C Borrowings, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees, and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Papers (including any amounts under Section 4.5) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

(c)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 4.4 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 4.1, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;

(d)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws;

(e)    in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

15.15    Confidentiality.

Each of Administrative Agent, Lenders, and the L/C Issuers agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees, and agents, including accountants, legal counsel, and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
141

extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Paper or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Paper or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided hereunder or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit facilities provided hereunder, (h) with the consent of Borrower, (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this section or (y) becomes available to Administrative Agent, any Lender, either L/C Issuer, or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Borrower, or (j) to any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in Financial Hedges or such contractual counterparty’s professional advisor (so long as such contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 15.15). For purposes of this section, “Information” means all information received from any Restricted Company relating to any Restricted Company or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Restricted Company, provided that, in the case of information received from a Restricted Company after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Each of Administrative Agent, Lenders, and the L/C Issuers acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning any Company, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information, and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including Federal and state securities Laws.

15.16    No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility

In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver, or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Paper), Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (i)(A) arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by Administrative Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the Lenders, are arm’s-length commercial transactions between Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Administrative Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory, and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks, and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Papers; (ii)(A) each of Administrative Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the Lenders is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent, or fiduciary for Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither Administrative Agent nor any Joint Lead Arranger or Lender has any obligation to Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Papers; and
142

(iii) Administrative Agent, Joint Lead Arrangers, the Lender and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither Administrative Agent, nor Joint Lead Arrangers, nor any Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against Administrative Agent, Joint Lead Arrangers and the Lenders with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.

15.17    USA PATRIOT Act Notice.

Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Act”), it is required to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies Borrower, which information includes the name and address of Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify Borrower in accordance with the Act. Borrower shall, promptly following a request by Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Act.

15.18    Survival of Representations and Warranties.
All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Paper or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Potential Default at the time of any Loan or L/C Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any L/C shall remain outstanding.

15.19    Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents.

This Agreement and any document, amendment, approval, consent, information, notice, certificate, request, statement, disclosure or authorization related to this Agreement (each a “Communication”), including Communications required to be in writing, may be in the form of an Electronic Record and may be executed using Electronic Signatures. Borrower agrees that any Electronic Signature on or associated with any Communication shall be valid and binding on Borrower to the same extent as a manual, original signature, and that any Communication entered into by Electronic Signature, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower enforceable against such in accordance with the terms thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed original signature was delivered. Any Communication may be executed in as many counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Communication. For the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this paragraph may include, without limitation, use or acceptance by the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically signed Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. The Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders may, at its option, create one or more copies of any Communication in the form of an imaged Electronic Record (“Electronic Copy”), which shall be
143

deemed created in the ordinary course of the such Person’s business, and destroy the original paper document. All Communications in the form of an Electronic Record, including an Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, (a) to the extent the Administrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of Borrower without further verification and (b) upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart. For purposes hereof, “Electronic Record” and “Electronic Signature” shall have the meanings assigned to them, respectively, by 15 USC §7006, as it may be amended from time to time.

15.20    ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN PAPERS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES. This Agreement supersedes all prior written agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof and may be supplemented only by documents delivered in accordance with the terms hereof.

15.21    Restatement of Existing Agreement.

The parties hereto agree that, on the Closing Date, after all conditions precedent set forth in Section 7.1 have been satisfied or waived: (a) the Obligation (as defined in this Agreement) represents, among other things, the restatement, renewal, amendment, extension, and modification of the “Obligation” (as defined in the Existing Agreement); (b) this Agreement is intended to, and does hereby, restate, renew, extend, amend, modify, supersede, and replace the Existing Agreement in its entirety; (c) the Notes, if any, executed pursuant to this Agreement amend, renew, extend, modify, replace, restate, substitute for, and supersede in their entirety (but do not extinguish the Debt arising under) the promissory notes issued pursuant to the Existing Agreement, which existing promissory notes shall be returned to Administrative Agent promptly after the Closing Date, marked “canceled and replaced”; (d) each Confirmation of Pledge Agreement executed pursuant to this Agreement ratifies and confirms (but does not extinguish or impair the collateral security created or evidenced by) the “Pledge Agreement” executed and delivered by the “Debtor” named therein pursuant to the Original Agreement and all subsequent amendments and restatements thereof (including, without limitation, the Existing Agreement); (e) the Confirmation of Guaranty executed pursuant to this Agreement ratifies and confirms (but does not extinguish or impair the “Guaranteed Debt” guaranteed by) the “Guaranty” executed and delivered pursuant to the Original Agreement and all subsequent amendments and restatements thereof (including, without limitation, the Existing Agreement); and (f) the entering into and performance of their respective obligations under the Loan Papers and the transactions evidenced hereby do not constitute a novation nor shall they be deemed to have terminated, extinguished, or discharged the “Debt” under the Existing Agreement, the Security Documents, the Guaranty, or the other Loan Papers (or the collateral security therefore), all of which Debt and Collateral shall continue under and be governed by this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, except as expressly provided otherwise herein.

15.22    Judgment Currency.
144


If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Paper in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer hereunder or under the other Loan Papers shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by Administrative Agent or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, Administrative Agent or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer from Borrower in the Agreement Currency, Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify Administrative Agent or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer in such currency, Administrative Agent or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).

15.23    ERISA.

Each Lender as of the Closing Date represents and warrants as of the Closing Date to the Administrative Agent and their respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit of the Borrower or any Guarantor, that such Lender is not and will not be (a) an employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA, (b) a plan or account subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (c) an entity deemed to hold “plan assets” of any such plans or accounts for purposes of ERISA or the Code or (d) a “governmental plan” within the meaning of ERISA.

15.24    Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Paper or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Paper, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

(a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution; and

(b)    the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:

(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;

(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or
145

other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper; or

(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.

15.25    Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs.

To the extent that the Loan Papers provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Financial Hedge or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Papers and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):

In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Papers that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Papers were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

As used in this Section 15.25, the following terms have the following meanings:

“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.

“Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §252.82(b); (ii) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §382.2(b).

“Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.

146

“QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).”
