WHEREAS, SES is a satellite operator providing communications solutions to broadcast, telecom, corporate, and government customers;

 

WHEREAS, SES is operating a constellation of satellites in medium-earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary-earth orbit (GEO) with a multi-terabit, high-throughput, low-latency network infrastructure (the “SES Satellite Network”), used for the global mobility market, including aviation, maritime, and the global fixed location market, including equipment, mobile back haul, teleport and data center co-location (collectively, “SES Applications”);

 

WHEREAS, SES has launched SES-17, a GEO satellite, and a series of MEO satellites (O3b), and will launch additional MEO satellites (“O3b mPOWER”) as part of the SES Satellite Network;

 

WHEREAS, AKOM and its affiliates are developing a satellite connected distributed data center (“Sat. DDC”) and provide satellite-based connectivity for the: mobility market, including airborne, maritime, automobile; the fixed-point markets, including equipment for house; and User Terminal for enterprise and government (collectively, “AKOM Applications”);

 

WHEREAS, AKOM and its affiliates are actively developing a semiconductor based phase array antenna (“AKOM Antenna”) to be installed at a Sat. DDC and to be used in AKOM Applications, with multiple telecom operators, government departments, and airlines;

 

WHEREAS, AKOM is evaluating a GEO/MEO hybrid solution to offer next-generation capacity for its mobility connectivity platform, and is researching non-geostationary (“NGSO”) capacity to supplement GEO and, as the NGSO constellations mature, to become a significant source for its network;

 

WHEREAS, SES and AKOM wish to collaborate for engineering and commercial testing and deployment of AKOM Antenna on the SES Satellite Network; and

 

WHEREAS, SES and AKOM intend to explore and refine potential areas of collaboration with a goal to executing a long-term agreement for the Project (as defined in paragraph 1);
