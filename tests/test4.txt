PENTAIR 2020 SHARE AND INCENTIVE PLAN
KEY TALENT AWARD AGREEMENT

Pursuant to the notice of grant (the “Grant Notice”) and this Key Talent Award Agreement, including any exhibits hereto (collectively, this “Award Agreement”), Pentair plc (the “Company”) has awarded you with a Key Talent Grant in the form of Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) with respect to the number of ordinary shares of the Company (“Shares”) specified in the Grant Notice. Capitalized terms not defined in this Award Agreement but defined in the Pentair plc 2020 Share and Incentive Plan, as may be amended or restated from time to time (the “Plan”), shall have the same definitions as in the Plan. Unless you decline this Award Agreement within 90 days, you agree to be bound by all of the provisions contained in this Award Agreement and the Plan.
1.Confidential Nature of Award. By accepting this Key Talent Grant, you acknowledge and agree that the terms, amount, and existence of this award be strictly confidential. You further agree that if you disclose any information regarding this award to anyone, you will forfeit any unvested portion of this award and you will be required to restore to the Company any amount realized under this Award Agreement.
2.Vesting. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or this Award Agreement, the RSUs will vest as provided in the Grant Notice.
3.Settlement of RSUs. The Company shall deliver to you a whole number of Shares equal to the number of RSUs (if any) that vest pursuant to this Award Agreement, subject to withholding of any Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 7 below) if required by applicable law. Such delivery shall take place as soon as administratively practicable following the vesting date, but in no event more than 30 days after the applicable vesting date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are resident or provide services outside of the United States, the Company, in its sole discretion, may provide for the settlement of the RSUs in the form of:
(a)     a cash payment in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares as of the vesting date that correspond to the number of vested RSUs to the extent that settlement in Shares (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or any of its Affiliates to obtain the approval of any governmental or regulatory body in your country of residence (or country of employment, if different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or any of its Affiliates or (iv) is administratively burdensome; or
(b)     Shares, but require you to sell such Shares immediately or within a specified period following your termination of service (in which case, you hereby agree that the Company shall have the authority to issue sale instructions in relation to such Shares on your behalf).
4.No Fractional Shares. Only whole Shares will be issuable pursuant to the RSUs; any fractional Share otherwise issuable under the RSUs will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share.
5.Effect of Termination of Service. In the event of termination of your service with the Company or any of its Affiliates for any reason (whether voluntarily or involuntarily), all your unvested RSUs will be cancelled and forfeited, subject to the following exceptions:

1
                                    


(a)     In the event of a Covered Termination (as defined in the Plan), your RSUs will become 100% vested at the time of termination.
(b)     If your employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates terminates due to death or Disability (as defined in the Plan), then a pro-rata portion of your award will vest at the time of your termination.
For purposes of the RSUs, your service will be considered terminated as of the date you cease active service with the Company or any of its Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide services or the terms of your employment or service agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company in its sole discretion, your right to vest in the RSUs under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you provide services or the terms of your employment or service agreement, if any). The Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you have ceased active service for purposes of your RSU grant (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence).
6.Dividend Equivalent Units. Any cash dividends paid with respect to record dates occurring from and after the Date of Grant until the date that the RSUs are settled will be automatically reinvested on the date the dividend is paid as additional RSUs that are subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and forfeiture provisions) as the underlying RSUs to which they relate.
7.Tax Withholding. You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you (the “Employer”), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by the Company or the Employer in their discretion to be an appropriate charge to you even if legally applicable to the Company or the Employer (“Tax-Related Items”), is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer, if any. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer; (ii) withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting of the RSUs either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this
2


authorization without further consent); (iii) withholding from the Shares to be delivered upon settlement of the RSUs that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required by law to be withheld; or (iv) permitting you to tender back to the Company a number of Shares delivered upon settlement of the RSUs or Shares previously owned by you having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required by law to be withheld. For purposes of the foregoing, no fractional Share will be withheld or issued pursuant to the grant of the RSUs and the issuance of Shares hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Section 16 Participant, your withholding obligations shall be satisfied as described in clause (iii) above, unless the Committee approves another form of payment for such Tax-Related Items.
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable statutory withholding rates (as determined by the Company in good faith and in its sole discretion) or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount from the relevant taxing authority in cash and will have no entitlement to the share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding from the Shares to be delivered upon vesting of the RSUs, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
You agree to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver Shares or proceeds from the sale of Shares until arrangements satisfactory to the Administrator have been made in connection with the Tax-Related Items. You will have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision.
8.Recoupment. The RSUs (and any compensation paid or Shares issued under the RSUs) are subject to recoupment in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any implementing regulations thereunder, any clawback policy adopted by the Company and any compensation recovery policy or practice otherwise required by applicable law. The Company shall have the right to offset against any other amounts due from the Company to you the amount owed by you hereunder.
9.Confidentiality, Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Non-Disparagement. As a condition to the receipt of the RSUs, you expressly agree to the terms and conditions in the Confidentiality, Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Non-Disparagement Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A. In addition to any remedies available to the Company under the first paragraph and Section 6 of Exhibit A, any violation of the terms and conditions of Exhibit A will result in a rescission of the RSUs made under this Award Agreement and a forfeiture of rights you have with respect thereto.
10.Securities Law Compliance. The grant of the RSUs and the issuance of Shares are subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or securities exchange as may be required. Notwithstanding any provision of this Award Agreement or the Plan, the Company has no liability to deliver any Shares under the Plan or make any payment unless such delivery or payment would comply with all laws and the applicable requirements of any governmental agency, securities exchange or similar entity, and unless and until you have taken all actions required by the Company in connection with the RSUs. The Company may impose such restrictions on any Shares issued under the Plan as the Company determines necessary or desirable to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations or requirements.
3


11.Transferability. The RSUs shall not be transferable in any manner (including without limitation, sale, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, or assignment) other than transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, unless otherwise determined by the Committee in accordance with the terms of the Plan. All rights with respect to the RSUs shall be exercisable during your lifetime only by you or your guardian or legal representative or permitted transferee.
12.Shareholder Rights. You shall not have any voting rights or any other rights and privileges of a shareholder of the Company unless and until Shares (if any) are issued upon settlement of the RSUs. Prior to actual payment of any RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
13.Insider Trading and/or Market Abuse. By participating in the Plan, you agree to comply with the Company’s policy on insider trading (to the extent that it is applicable to you). You further acknowledge that, depending on your or your broker’s country of residence or where the Shares are listed, you may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws which may affect your ability to accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares (e.g., RSUs) or rights linked to the value of Shares, during such times you are considered to have “inside information” regarding the Company as defined by the laws or regulations in your country. Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you place before you possessed inside information. Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (i) disclosing the inside information to any third party (other than on a “need to know” basis) and (ii) “tipping” third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities. You understand that third parties include fellow employees. Any restriction under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and that you should therefore consult your personal advisor on this matter.
14.Code Section 409A. For U.S. taxpayers, it is the intent that the RSUs as set forth in this Award Agreement shall qualify for exemption from or comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so qualify or comply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined that the RSUs fail to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral period exemption and are otherwise deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, and if you are a “specified employee” as of the date of your “separation from service” (as those terms are defined in the Plan or Section 409A of the Code), then the issuance of any Shares that would otherwise be made upon the date of your separation from service or within the first six (6) months thereafter will not be made on the originally scheduled date and will instead be issued in a lump sum on the date that is six (6) months and one day after the date of your separation from service, but only if such delay in the issuance of the Shares is necessary to avoid the imposition of additional taxation on you in respect of the Shares under Section 409A of the Code. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify this Award Agreement as may be necessary to ensure that all payments provided for under this Award Agreement are made in a manner that qualifies for exemption from or complies with Section 409A of the Code; provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the grant, vesting, or settlement of RSUs provided for under this Award Agreement will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to the grant, vesting or settlement of RSUs provided for under this Award Agreement. The Company will have no liability to you or any other party if the RSUs, the delivery of Shares upon settlement of the RSUs or other payment hereunder that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A of the Code, is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Company with respect thereto.

15.Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an online or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.

(c)all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
(d)your participation in the Plan is voluntary;
(e)the RSUs and your participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment or be interpreted as forming an employment or service contract with the Company or any of its Affiliates and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, any of its Affiliates or the Employer, as applicable, to terminate your employment or service relationship (as otherwise may be permitted under local law);
(f)the RSUs and the Shares, and the income and value of the same, subject to the RSUs are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
(g)the RSUs and any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer or any Affiliate;
(h)the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(i)no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSUs resulting from termination of your service (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws or later found invalid), and in consideration of the grant of the RSUs to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of its Affiliates, or the Employer, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, its Affiliates and the Employer, from any such claim;

5


(k)if you are employed or providing services outside of the United States, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the U.S. dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs or any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon settlement of the RSUs.
17.Data Privacy. You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Award Agreement, the Grant Notice and any other RSU grant materials by and among, as necessary and applicable, the Company or any of its Affiliates, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. If there is a conflict between this Section 17 and the Company’s existing policies and/or data protection charters, the terms of this Section 17 will prevail with respect to issues related to the RSUs and the Plan.
You understand that the Company and/or the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, social security or insurance number, passport number or other identification number, salary, nationality, and any Shares or directorships held in the Company, and details of the RSUs or any other entitlement to Shares, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
You understand that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Stock Plan Services or such other share plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country.

Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your service status and career will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you RSUs or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan.

For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

The Addendum constitutes part of this Award Agreement.
23.Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the RSUs, and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

You understand that in connection with such Protected Activity, you are permitted to disclose documents or other information as permitted by law, and without giving notice to, or receiving authorization from, Company.
