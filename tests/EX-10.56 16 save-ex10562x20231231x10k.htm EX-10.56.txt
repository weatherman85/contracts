APPENDIX 1

18 Buyer Furnished Equipment

18.1 Administration

18.1.1.1	
In accordance with the Specification, the Seller shall install those items of equipment that are identified in the Specification as being furnished by the Buyer ("Buyer Furnished Equipment" or "BFE"), provided that the BFE and the supplier of such BFE (the "BFE Supplier") are referred to in the Airbus BFE Product Catalog valid at the time the BFE Supplier is selected.
 

18.1.1.2	
Notwithstanding the foregoing and without prejudice to Clause 2.4, if the Buyer wishes to install BFE manufactured by a supplier who is not referred to in the Airbus BFE Product Catalog, the Buyer shall so inform the Seller and the Seller shall conduct a feasibility study of the Buyer's request, in order to consider approving such supplier, provided that such request is compatible with the Seller's industrial planning and the associated Scheduled Delivery Month for the Buyer's Aircraft. In addition, it is a prerequisite to such approval that the considered supplier be qualified by the Seller's Aviation Authorities to produce equipment for installation on civil aircraft. Any approval of a supplier by the Seller shall be performed at the Buyer's expense. The Buyer shall cause any BFE supplier approved under this Clause 18.1.1.2 (each an "Approved BFE Supplier") to comply with the conditions set forth in this Clause 18 and specifically Clause 18.2.
 



Except for the specific purposes of this Clause 18.1.1.2, the term "BFE Supplier" shall be deemed to include Approved BFE Suppliers.

18.1.2.1	
The Seller shall advise the Buyer of the dates by which, in the planned release of engineering for the Aircraft, the Seller requires a written detailed engineering definition, encompassing a Declaration of Design and Performance (the "BFE Engineering Definition"). The Seller shall provide to the Buyer and/or the BFE Supplier(s), within an appropriate timeframe, the necessary interface documentation to enable the development of the BFE Engineering Definition.
 
The BFE Engineering Definition shall include the description of the dimensions and weight of BFE, the information related to its certification and the information necessary for the installation and operation thereof, including when applicable 3D models compatible with the Seller's systems. The Buyer shall furnish, or cause the BFE Suppliers to furnish, the BFE Engineering Definition by the dates specified.

Thereafter, the BFE Engineering Definition shall not be revised, except through an SCN executed in accordance with Clause 2.



image_6a.jpg


APPENDIX 1

18.1.2.2	The Seller shall also provide in due time to the Buyer a schedule of dates and the shipping addresses for delivery of the BFE and, where requested by the Seller, additional spare BFE to permit installation in the Aircraft and Delivery of the Aircraft in accordance with the Aircraft delivery schedule. The Buyer shall provide, or cause the BFE Suppliers to provide, the BFE by such dates in a serviceable condition, in order to allow performance of any assembly, installation, test or acceptance process in accordance with the Seller's industrial schedule. In order to facilitate the follow-up of the timely receipt of BFE, the Buyer shall, upon the Seller's request, provide to the Seller dates and references of all BFE purchase orders placed by the Buyer.
 

The Buyer shall also provide, when requested by the Seller, at Airbus Operations S.A.S. works in Toulouse, France, at Airbus Operations GmbH Works in Hamburg, Germany and/or the Airbus Americas Inc. facility in Mobile, Alabama, as applicable, adequate field service including support from BFE suppliers to act in a technical advisory capacity to the Seller in the installation, calibration and possible repair of any BFE.

18.1.3	Without prejudice to the Buyer's obligations hereunder, in order to facilitate the development of the BFE Engineering Definition, the Seller shall organize meetings between the Buyer and BFE Suppliers. The Buyer hereby agrees to participate in such meetings and to provide adequate technical and engineering expertise to reach decisions within the defined timeframe.
 

In addition, throughout the development phase and up to Delivery of the Aircraft to the Buyer, the Buyer agrees:



•	to monitor the BFE Suppliers and ensure that they shall enable the Buyer to fulfil its obligations, including but not limited to those set forth in the Customization Milestone Chart;
 

•	that, should a timeframe, quality or other type of risk be identified at a given BFE Supplier, the Buyer shall allocate resources to such BFE Supplier so as not to jeopardize the industrial schedule of the Aircraft;
 

•	for major BFE, including, but not being limited to, seats, galleys and IFE ("Major BFE") to participate on a mandatory basis in the specific meetings that take place between BFE Supplier selection and BFE delivery, namely:
 

◦	
Preliminary Design Review ("PDR"),
 

◦	
Critical Design Review ("CDR");
 

•	
to attend the First Article Inspection ("FAI") for the first shipset of all Major BFE. Should the Buyer not attend such FAI, the Buyer shall delegate the FAI
 


image_6a.jpg


APPENDIX 1

to the BFE Supplier and confirmation thereof shall be supplied to the Seller in writing;

•	
to attend the Source Inspection ("SI") that takes place at the BFE Supplier's premises prior to shipping, for each shipset of all Major BFE. Should the Buyer not attend such SI, the Buyer shall delegate the SI to the BFE Supplier and confirmation thereof shall be brought to the Seller in writing. Should the Buyer not attend the SI, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the conclusions of the BFE Supplier with respect to such SI.
 

The Seller shall be entitled to attend the PDR, the CDR and the FAI. In doing so, the Seller's employees shall be acting in an advisory capacity only and at no time shall they be deemed to be acting as Buyer's employees or agents, either directly or indirectly.

18.1.4.1 The BFE shall be imported into FRANCE or into GERMANY by the Buyer under a suspensive customs system ("Régime de l'entrepôt douanier ou régime de perfectionnement actif " or "Zollverschluss") without application of any French or German tax or customs duty, and shall be Delivered At Place (DAP) according to the Incoterms, to the following shipping addresses:
AIRBUS OPERATIONS S.A.S.
316 Route de Bayonne
31300 TOULOUSE


FRANCE

or

AIRBUS OPERATIONS GmbH
Kreetslag 10
21129 HAMBURG
GERMANY

or such other location as may be specified by the Seller.

18.1.4.2 BFE delivered to the Seller's Affiliate in Mobile, Alabama, as may be specified by the Seller pursuant to Clause 18.1.4.1, will be shipped according to the Incoterms 2010 "Delivered Duty Paid" Airbus Americas, Inc., Mobile, Alabama.

18.1.5	If the Buyer requests the Seller to supply directly certain items that are considered BFE according to the Specification, and if such request is notified to the Seller in due time in order not to affect the delivery date of the Aircraft, the Seller will agree to order such items subject to the execution of an SCN reflecting the effect on price, escalation adjustment, and any other conditions of the Agreement including a handling charge in the amount of [***] of the cost of the BFE item for any items up
 


image_6a.jpg


APPENDIX 1

to [***]. If the cost of the BFE item exceeds [***] the Buyer and the Seller will execute an SCN reflecting the cost of such BFE and a handling charge to be mutually agreed upon execution of such SCN. The Seller will bear no liability in respect of delay and product support commitments for such items.

18.2 Requirements

The Buyer is responsible for ensuring, at its expense, and warrants that the BFE shall:

•	be manufactured by a qualified BFE Supplier, and
 

•	meet the requirements of the applicable Specification of the Aircraft, and
 

•	be delivered with the relevant certification documentation, including but not limited to the DDP, and
 

•	comply with the BFE Engineering Definition, and
 



•	comply with applicable requirements incorporated by reference to the Type Certificate and listed in the Type Certificate Data Sheet, and
 

•	be approved by the Aviation Authority issuing the Export Airworthiness Certificate and by the Buyer's Aviation Authority for installation and use on the Aircraft at the time of Delivery of the Aircraft, and
 

•	not infringe any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right of the Seller or any third party, and
 

•	not be subject to any legal obligation or other encumbrance that may prevent, hinder or delay the installation of the BFE in the Aircraft and/or the Delivery of the Aircraft.
 

The Seller shall be entitled to refuse any item of BFE that it considers incompatible with the Specification, the BFE Engineering Definition or the certification requirements.

18.3 Buyer's Obligation and Seller's Remedies

18.3.1 Any delay or failure in

(i) furnishing the BFE in serviceable condition at the requested delivery date,

(ii)	complying with Clause 18.2 or in providing the descriptive information or service representatives required by Clause 18.1.1, or
 


image_6a.jpg


APPENDIX 1


(iii)	obtaining any required approval for such equipment under the Aviation Authorities' regulations
 

may delay the performance of any act to be performed by the Seller, and cause the Final Contract Price of the Aircraft to be adjusted in accordance with the updated delivery schedule and the provisions of Clause 10. The additional costs the Seller incurs that are attributable in any material degree to such delay for storage, taxes, insurance and out of sequence installation shall be for the Buyer's account. The Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to minimize or mitigate such delay.

18.3.2	The Buyer will use reasonable commercial efforts to monitor the manufacturing, inspection and timely availability of BFE to meet the Seller's delivery requirements.
 



(i)	if the Buyer discovers that the BFE delivery program is behind schedule and determines in conjunction with the BFE manufacturer that the Seller's delivery requirements cannot be met, the Buyer will, without delay, notify the Seller of the situation and of the expected delivery dates. The Buyer and Seller will mutually agree on a plan to minimize any additional costs for changes to the Seller's production program to accommodate the delay in BFE delivery. Any such additional costs will be borne by the Buyer.
 

(ii)	provided such delay is in excess of [***] and a mutual agreement with respect to a recovery plan referred to in (i) above has not been reached, in addition to the consequences outlined in Clause 18.3.1, in the event of a delay or failure described in 18.3.1, the Seller, using reasonable efforts to mitigate cost, may select, purchase and install equipment similar to the BFE at issue, in which event the Final Contract Price of the affected Aircraft will also be increased by the actual purchase price of such equipment, plus handling charge in the amount of [***] of the purchase price of the BFE item and the cost of transportation, insurance, packaging and, if required and not already provided for in the price of the Aircraft, for inspection, acceptance, adjustment and calibration; or
 

(iii)	if the BFE is delayed more than [***] beyond, or unapproved within, [***] of the date referenced in Clause 18.1.1, then the Seller may deliver or the Buyer may elect to have the Aircraft delivered without the installation of such BFE, notwithstanding the terms of Clause 7.2 insofar as it may otherwise have applied, whereon the Seller will be relieved of all obligations to install such equipment.
 

18.4 Title and Risk of Loss

Title to and risk of loss of BFE will at all times remain with the Buyer, except that risk of loss (limited to cost of replacement of said BFE and excluding in particular


image_6a.jpg


APPENDIX 1

loss of use) will be with the Seller for as long as the BFE is in the care, custody and control of the Seller.

18.5 Disposition of BFE Following Termination

18.5.1	If a termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Clause 21 hereof occurs with respect to an Aircraft in which all or any part of the BFE has been installed prior to the date of such termination, the Seller will be entitled, but not required, to remove all items of BFE which can be removed without damage to the Aircraft and to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the sale of such items of BFE to other customers, retaining and applying the proceeds of such sales to reduce Seller's damages resulting from the termination.
 

18.5.2	The Buyer will cooperate with the Seller in facilitating the sale of BFE pursuant to Clause 18.5.1 above and will be responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by the Seller in removing and facilitating the sale of such BFE. The Buyer will reimburse the Seller for all such reasonable costs within [***] of receiving documentation substantiating such costs from the Seller.
 



18.5.3	The Seller will notify the Buyer as to those items of BFE not sold by the Seller pursuant to Clause 18.5.1 above and, at the Seller's request, the Buyer will undertake to remove such items from the Seller' facility within [***] of the date of such notice. The Buyer will have no claim against the Seller for damage or destruction of any item of BFE removed from the Aircraft and not removed from Seller's facility within such period.
 

18.5.4	The Buyer will have no claim against the Seller for damage to or destruction of any item of BFE damaged or destroyed in the process of being deinstalled from the Aircraft, provided that the Seller shall have used reasonable care in such deinstallation.
 

18.5.5	The Buyer at no cost to the Seller will grant title to the Seller for any BFE items that cannot be removed from the Aircraft without causing damage to the Aircraft or rendering any system in the Aircraft unusable.
 

18.5.6	If the termination was not a result of an Excusable Delay attributable to the Buyer or a Buyer Termination Event, the Seller shall pay the Buyer for the cost of such BFE.
