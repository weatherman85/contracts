(b)    Changes in GAAP. If at any time any change in GAAP would affect the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan Document in any material respect, and either the Parent Borrower or the Required Lenders shall so request, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Parent Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders); provided, that (i) following such request, until so amended, such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and (ii) following such request, until so amended, the Parent Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent (for distribution to the Lenders) financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably

1.05    Rounding. Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Parent Borrower pursuant to this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).

1.08    Interest Rates; LIBOR Notification. The interest rate on Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Overnight Rate Loans is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate, the EURIBOR Screen Rate, the CDOR Screen Rate, the AUD Screen Rate, the Overnight AUD Rate, the Canadian Prime Rate or the Overnight LIBO Rate, as applicable, some or all of which are derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the “IBA”) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered ratea Loan denominated in dollars or a Foreign Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. In the event that the London interbank offeredapplicable interest rate is no longer available or in certain other circumstances as set forth in Section 3.03(b) of this Agreement, such Section 3.03(b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will notify the Parent Borrower, pursuant to Section 3.03(b), in advance of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Rate Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of “Eurocurrency Rate”, “EURIBOR Screen Rate”, “CDOR Screen Rate”, “AUD Screen Rate”, “Overnight AUD Rate”, “Canadian Prime Rate” or “Overnight LIBO Rate”any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate, as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Section 3.03, will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the

- 43 -

    

Eurocurrency Rate, the EURIBOR Screen Rate, the CDOR Screen Rate, the AUD Screen Rate, the Overnight AUD Rate, Canadian Prime Rate or the Overnight LIBO Rateexisting interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offeredany existing interest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrowers. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrowers, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.
1.09    Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person; and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized and acquired on the first date of its existence by the holders of its equity interests at such time.

Each telephonic notice by a Tranche 6 Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of such Tranche 6 Borrower. Each Tranche 6 Committed Loan Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, or if the remaining amount available under the Tranche 6 Commitments is less than $5,000,000, in multiples of $1,000,000.

Any other fees payable to the Tranche 2 Issuing Banks pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(c)    Other Fees. The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees in the amounts and on the dates as set forth in any fee agreements with the Administrative Agent and to perform any other obligations contained therein. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
(i)    The Parent Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
(d)    Fees Generally. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in U.S. Dollars, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to them) for distribution, in the case of Commitment Fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
2.18    Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for ABR Loans when the ABR is determined by reference to the Prime Rate and the Daily Simple RFR with respect to Pounds Sterling shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All computations of interest for Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Pounds Sterling, Australian Dollars and Canadian Dollars shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days, and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All computations of interest for Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars and Euros shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All computations of interest for Overnight Rate Loans denominated in Pounds Sterling, Australian Dollars and Canadian Dollars shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days, and shall be

- 64 -

    

payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All computations of interest for Overnight Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars and Euros and all computations of interest for and the Daily Simple RFR with respect to Euros shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is repaid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.20(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or applicable Overnight Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
2.19    Evidence of Debt. The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of any of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing by it with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Tranche, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
2.20    Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback.
(a)    General. All payments to be made by each Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by each Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, (x) in the case of payments denominated in U.S. Dollars, at the Administrative Agent’s Office and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. Local Time on the date specified herein and (y) in the case of payments denominated in any Foreign Currency, its Foreign Currency Payment Office for such Foreign Currency; provided that any payments to be made directly to the Tranche 2 Issuing Banks or Tranche 2 Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each relevant Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein, including, in the case of prepayments of and interest on commitments, if the outstanding Committed Loans are not ratable in proportion to the Applicable Percentages, to each Lender ratably based on the amount owed to it) with respect to payments received in respect of the Commitments. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. Local Time shall, solely for purposes of calculating interest and fees hereunder, be deemed received on the next Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by a Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be

- 65 -

    

made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan or Tranche 2 LC Disbursement shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made in the currency of such Loan or Tranche 2 LC Disbursement, and all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in U.S. Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Borrowing or Tranche 2 LC Disbursement in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such Foreign Currency with the result that such Foreign Currency no longer exists or a Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Foreign Currency, then all payments to be made by such Borrower hereunder in such Foreign Currency shall instead be made when due in a currency that replaced such Foreign Currency or, if no such replacement currency exists, in U.S. Dollars in an amount equal to the U.S. Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the such Borrower takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
(b)    Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any borrowing of ABR Loans, Overnight Rate Loans, or Tranche 2 Swingline Borrowing, prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02, Section 2.04, Section 2.06, Section 2.08, Section 2.10 or Section 2.12, as applicable, (or, in the case of a Borrowing of ABR Loans, or Overnight Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02, Section 2.04, Section 2.06, Section 2.08, Section 2.10 or Section 2.12, as applicable) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules and conventions on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the applicable Loan or, if such payment is in U.S. Dollars, ABR Loans. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by it for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Committed Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by a Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
(c)    Payments by any Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the

- 66 -

    

Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules and conventions on interbank compensation. Any payment by any Lender pursuant to this clause (c) shall be without prejudice to any claim such Lender or the Administrative Agent may have against the applicable Borrower for having failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or any Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(d)    Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the applicable Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowings set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender within one Business Day, without interest.
(e)    Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c).
(f)    Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
2.21    Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it or participations in Tranche 2 LC Disbursements or Tranche 2 Swingline Loans, if applicable, resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans and participations in Tranche 2 LC Disbursements and Tranche 2 Swingline Loans, if applicable, and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and participations in Tranche 2 LC Disbursements and Tranche 2 Swingline Loans, if applicable, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders in the applicable Tranche ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and participations in Tranche 2 LC Disbursements and Tranche 2 Swingline Loans, if applicable, and other amounts owing them; provided, that: (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by any Loan Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or participations in Tranche 2 LC Disbursements and Tranche 2

- 67 -

    

Swingline Loans, if applicable, to any assignee or participant, other than to the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). The Parent Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
2.22    Extension of Maturity Date.
(a)    Requests for Extension. The Parent Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders) not earlier than 60 Business Days and not later than 35 Business Days prior to any anniversary of the Closing Date (each a “Relevant Anniversary Date”), request that each Tranche 1 Lender, Tranche 2 Lender, Tranche 3 Lender, Tranche 4 Lender, Tranche 5 Lender and/or Tranche 6 Lender, as the case may be, extend the Maturity Date then in effect for Tranche 1, Tranche 2, Tranche 3, Tranche 4, Tranche 5 and/or Tranche 6, as the case may be, for an additional year from the applicable Maturity Date then in effect hereunder (the “Existing Maturity Date”); provided, that the Parent Borrower may not request such extension on more than two Relevant Anniversary Dates (it being agreed that a request for an extension of the Maturity Date of Tranche 1, Tranche 2, Tranche 3, Tranche 4, Tranche 5 and/or Tranche 6 at the same time shall constitute a single extension request).
(b)    Lender Elections to Extend. Each Tranche 1 Lender, Tranche 2 Lender, Tranche 3 Lender, Tranche 4 Lender, Tranche 5 Lender and/or Tranche 6 Lender, as the case may be, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given not earlier than 30 Business Days prior to the Relevant Anniversary Date and not later than the date (the “Notice Date”) that is 20 Business Days prior to the Relevant Anniversary Date, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (and each Lender that determines not to so extend the Maturity Date of Tranche 1, Tranche 2, Tranche 3, Tranche 4, Tranche 5 and/or Tranche 6, as the case may be, a “Non-Extending Lender”) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date) and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree. Following any extension the Tranche 2 LC Exposure shall continue to be held ratably among the Tranche 2 Lenders, but on the Maturity Date applicable to the Tranche 2 Committed Loans of any Non-Extending Lender with a Tranche 2 Commitment, the Tranche 2 LC Exposure of such Non-Extending Lender shall be ratably reallocated, to the extent of the unused Tranche 2 Commitments of the extending Tranche 2 Lenders, to such extending Tranche 2 Lenders (without regard to whether the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 can then be satisfied) and the applicable Tranche 2 Borrowers shall cash collateralize the balance of such Tranche 2 LC Exposure in accordance with Section 2.25.
(c)    Notification by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower of each Tranche 1 Lender’s, Tranche 2 Lender’s, Tranche 3 Lender’s, Tranche 4 Lender’s, Tranche 5 Lender’s or Tranche 6 Lender’s, as the case may be, determination under this Section no later than the date 15 Business Days prior to the Relevant Anniversary Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the immediately preceding Business Day).

(e)    Tranche 1 Minimum Extension Requirement. If (and only if) the total of the Tranche 1 Commitments of the Tranche 1 Lenders that have agreed so to extend the Maturity Date of Tranche 1 (each, a “Tranche 1 Extending Lender”) and the additional Tranche 1 Commitments of the Additional Commitment Lenders shall be more than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Tranche 1 Commitments in the aggregate in effect immediately prior to the Relevant Anniversary Date, then, effective as of the Relevant Anniversary Date, the Maturity Date of Tranche 1 for each Tranche 1 Extending Lender and of each Additional Commitment Lender in respect of such Tranche providing a Tranche 1 Commitment shall be extended to the date falling 364 days after the Existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date of Tranche 1 as so extended shall be the immediately preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender providing a Tranche 1 Commitment shall thereupon become a “Tranche 1 Lender” for all purposes of this Agreement.

At the time of sending such notice, the Parent Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each applicable Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to such Lenders).
(b)    Lender Elections to Increase. Each Tranche 1 Lender, in the case of any increase to the Tranche 1 Commitments, each Tranche 2 Lender, in case of any increase to the Tranche 2 Commitments, each Tranche 3 Lender, in case of any increase to the Tranche 3 Commitments, each Tranche 4 Lender, in case of any increase to the Tranche 4 Commitments, each Tranche 5 Lender, in case of any increase to the Tranche 5 Commitments and each Tranche 6 Lender, in case of any increase to the Tranche 6 Commitments shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Tranche 1 Commitment, Tranche 2 Commitment, Tranche 3 Commitment, Tranche 4 Commitment, Tranche 5 Commitment and/or Tranche 6 Commitment, as the case may be, and if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Tranche 1 Applicable Percentage, Tranche 2 Applicable Percentage, Tranche 3 Applicable Percentage, Tranche 4 Applicable Percentage, Tranche 5 Applicable Percentage and/or Tranche 6 Applicable Percentage, as the case may be, of such requested increase.

If the Tranche 1 Commitments, Tranche 2 Commitments, Tranche 3 Commitments, Tranche 4 Commitments, Tranche 5 Commitments and/or Tranche 6 Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower shall determine the effective date (the “Increase Effective Date”) and the final allocation of such increase among the applicable Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower and the applicable Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.
(e)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As a condition precedent to such increase, the Parent Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate dated as of the Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Parent Borrower approving or consenting to, or otherwise authorizing the amount of, such increase and (ii) certifying that, immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V that are qualified by materiality shall be true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, and such representations and warranties that are not qualified by materiality shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date (provided, that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representation or warranty that already is qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof), and except that for purposes of this Section 2.23, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements delivered pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01, and (B) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such Increase Effective Date and after giving effect thereto. The applicable Borrowers shall prepay any Committed Loans of the applicable Tranche outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding applicable Committed Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section.
(f)    Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.21 or 11.01 to the contrary.

(a)    Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Tranche 2 Swingline Lender severally agrees to make Tranche 2 Swingline Loans to the Parent Borrower from time to time during the Tranche 2 Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Tranche 2 Swingline Loans exceeding $500,000,000, (ii) the Tranche 2 Total Outstandings exceeding the Aggregate Tranche 2 Commitments and (iii) the sum of (x) the Tranche 2 Swingline Exposure of such Tranche 2 Swingline Lender (in its capacity as a Tranche 2 Swingline Lender and a Tranche 2 Loan Lender), (y) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Tranche 2 Committed Loans made by such Tranche 2 Swingline Lender (in its capacity as a Tranche 2 Lender) and (z) the Tranche 2 LC Exposure of such Tranche 2 Swingline Lender (in its capacity as a Tranche 2 Lender) exceeding such Tranche 2 Lender’s Tranche 2 Commitment then in effect; provided, that no Tranche 2 Swingline Lender shall be required to make a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Each Tranche 2 Swingline Loan shall (unless otherwise agreed by the applicable Tranche 2 Swingline Lender) be in an amount that is a whole multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Parent Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans. Tranche 2 Swingline Loans shall be denominated in U.S. Dollars.

(b)    To request a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan, the Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), or pursuant to other procedures agreed to by the Administrative Agent, not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time (or such other time as may be acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Tranche 2 Swingline Lender), on the day of a proposed Tranche 2 Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Tranche 2 Swingline Loan and the applicable Tranche 2 Swingline Lender; provided, that no Tranche 2 Swingline Lender shall be required to make a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan in excess of the amount permitted under Section 2.24. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise (and in no event later than 4:00 p.m. New York City time) the applicable Tranche 2 Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Parent Borrower. The applicable Tranche 2 Swingline Lender shall make Tranche 2 Swingline Loans available to the Parent Borrower by means of a credit to an account designated by the Parent Borrower reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of a Tranche 2 LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.25(e), by remittance to the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank) by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Tranche 2 Swingline Loan.
(c)    The failure of any Tranche 2 Swingline Lender to make its portion of a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan shall not relieve any other Tranche 2 Swingline Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its portion of such Tranche 2 Swingline Loan on the date of such Tranche 2 Swingline Loan, but no Tranche 2 Swingline Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Tranche 2 Swingline Lender to make the portion of a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan to be made by such other Tranche 2 Swingline Lender on the date of any Tranche 2 Swingline Loan.
(d)    The Tranche 2 Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day require the Tranche 2 Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Tranche 2 Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Tranche 2 Swingline Loans in which Tranche 2 Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Tranche 2 Lender, specifying in such notice such Tranche 2 Lender’s Tranche 2 Applicable Percentage of such Tranche 2 Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Tranche 2 Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender, such Tranche 2 Lender’s Tranche 2 Applicable Percentage of such Tranche 2 Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Tranche 2 Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Tranche 2 Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Tranche 2 Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Tranche 2 Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.20 with respect to Tranche 2 Loans made by such Tranche 2 Lender (and Section 2.20 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Tranche 2 Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Tranche 2 Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower of any participations in any Tranche 2 Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Tranche 2 Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender from the Parent Borrower (or other party on behalf of a Tranche 2) in respect of a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan after receipt by the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent, and any such amounts so received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Tranche 2

- 73 -

    

Lenders that have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender, as applicable; provided, that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Parent Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Parent Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.
(e)    The Tranche 2 Swingline Lender shall not be required to make any Tranche 2 Swingline Loan after the Maturity Date as applicable to its Tranche 2 Committed Loans, and any Tranche 2 Swingline Loans outstanding on the Maturity Date of the Tranche 2 Committed Loans of any Tranche 2 Lender shall be prepaid on such date.
(f)    Replacement of the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender. Any Tranche 2 Swingline Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Tranche 2 Swingline Lender and the successor Tranche 2 Swingline Lender or in accordance with Section 11.13. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Tranche 2 Lenders of any such replacement of the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, each applicable Tranche 2 Borrower shall repay all outstanding Tranche 2 Swingline Loans in accordance with Section 2.15. From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Tranche 2 Swingline Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Tranche 2 Swingline Lender under this Agreement with respect to the Tranche 2 Swingline Loans to be made thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Tranche 2 Swingline Lender” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Tranche 2 Swingline Lender, or to such successor and all previous Tranche 2 Swingline Lenders, as the context shall require. After the replacement of the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender hereunder, the replaced Tranche 2 Swingline Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of the Tranche 2 Swingline Lender under this Agreement with respect to Tranche 2 Swingline Loans made by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to make any new Tranche 2 Swingline Loans.
2.25    Tranche 2 Letters of Credit.
(a)    General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein the Parent Borrower may request the issuance of standby letters of credit (each a “Tranche 2 Letter of Credit”) denominated in any Ratable Currency as the applicant thereof for the support of its or its Subsidiaries’ obligations, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the applicable Tranche 2 Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Parent Borrower to, or entered into by the Parent Borrower with, the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank relating to any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. Notwithstanding Section 1.06, unless otherwise specified in such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, all references in any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit to times of day shall be references to Local Time. No Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to issue any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit if: any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank from issuing the Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Tranche 2 Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank with respect to the Tranche 2 Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank any loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date (for which such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank is not otherwise

- 74 -

    

compensated hereunder) and which such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it.
(b)    Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Tranche 2 Letter of Credit), the Parent Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank) to such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, but in any event no less than three Business Days) a notice requesting the issuance of a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, or identifying the Tranche 2 Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section 2.25), the amount of such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, the Ratable Currency applicable thereto, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, the Parent Borrower shall also submit a letter of credit application on such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit. A Tranche 2 Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit the Parent Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, subject to Sections 2.13(b) and this Section 2.25, (i) the U.S. Dollar Amount of the Tranche 2 LC Exposure shall not exceed $150,000,000, (ii) the U.S. Dollar Amount of the Tranche 2 LC Exposure of any Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall not exceed the aggregate amount of its Tranche 2 LC Commitment, and (iii) the U.S. Dollar Amount of the Tranche 2 Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Tranche 2 Commitments.
(c)    Expiration Date. Each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination by notice from the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date of the Tranche 2 Committed Loans of such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank.
(d)    Participations. By the issuance of a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank or the Tranche 2 Lenders, such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Tranche 2 Lender, and each Tranche 2 Lender hereby acquires from such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, a participation in such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit equal to such Tranche 2 Lender’s Tranche 2 Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Tranche 2 Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, such Tranche 2 Lender’s Tranche 2 Applicable Percentage of each Tranche 2 LC Disbursement made by such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Parent Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.25, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Parent Borrower for any reason. Each Tranche 2 Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Tranche 2 Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Tranche 2 Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

- 75 -

    

(e)    Reimbursement. If a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall make any Tranche 2 LC Disbursement in respect of a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, the Parent Borrower shall reimburse such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement in the applicable Ratable Currency not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Parent Borrower receives such notice; provided, that if such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement is denominated in U.S. Dollars and is not less than $100,000, the Parent Borrower, subject to the conditions to Borrowing set forth herein, may request in accordance with Section 2.04(b) or this Section 2.25 that such payment be financed with a Borrowing of ABR Loans or a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan in the U.S. Dollar Amount of such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement and, to the extent so financed, the Parent Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Borrowing of ABR Loans or a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan. If the Parent Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Tranche 2 Lender of the applicable Tranche 2 LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Parent Borrower in respect thereof and such Tranche 2 Lender’s Tranche 2 Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Tranche 2 Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Tranche 2 Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Parent Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(b) with respect to Tranche 2 Loans made by such Tranche 2 Lender (and Section 2.20 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Tranche 2 Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Tranche 2 Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Parent Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Tranche 2 Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, then to such Tranche 2 Lenders and such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, as applicable. Any payment made by a Tranche 2 Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank for any Tranche 2 LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Loans or a Tranche 2 Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Tranche 2 Loan and shall not relieve the Parent Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement. If the Parent Borrower’s reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Foreign Currency would subject a Credit Party to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in U.S. Dollars, the Parent Borrower shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by such Credit Party or (y) reimburse each Tranche 2 LC Disbursement made in such Foreign Currency in U.S. Dollars, in an amount equal to the U.S. Dollar Amount of such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement on the date such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement is made.
(f)    Obligations Absolute. The Borrowers’ obligations to reimburse Tranche 2 LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.25 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank under a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.25, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Parent Borrower’s obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Tranche 2 Lenders nor any Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances

- 76 -

    

referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank; provided, that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank from liability to the Parent Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Parent Borrower’s to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Parent Borrower that are caused by such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit.
(g)    Disbursement Procedures. A Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit. Such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, the Parent Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank has made or will make a Tranche 2 LC Disbursement thereunder; provided, that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Parent Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank and the Tranche 2 Lenders with respect to any such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement.
(h)    Interim Interest. If a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall make any Tranche 2 LC Disbursement, then, unless the Parent Borrower shall reimburse such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement in full on the date such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such Tranche 1 LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Parent Borrower reimburses such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans (or, if such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement is denominated in a Foreign Currency, the rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules and conventions on interbank compensation for such Foreign Currency plus the then effective Tranche 2 Applicable Rate with respect to Eurocurrency Rate Loans); provided, that if the Parent Borrower fails to reimburse such Tranche 2 LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.25, then Section 2.16(b) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Tranche 2 Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.25 to reimburse such Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Tranche 2 Lender to the extent of such payment.
(i)    Replacement and resignation of an Issuing Bank. A Tranche 2 Issuing Bank may resign at any time by giving 30 days’ prior notice to the Administrative Agent, the Tranche 2 Lenders and the Parent Borrower, or may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Tranche 2 Issuing Bank and the successor Tranche 2 Issuing Bank or in accordance with Section 11.13. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Tranche 2 Lenders of any such replacement or resignation of a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement or resignation shall become effective, the Parent

- 77 -

    

Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced or resigned Tranche 2 Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.17(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement or resignation, (i) the successor Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced or resigned Tranche 2 Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Tranche 2 Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Tranche 2 Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Tranche 2 Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement or resignation of a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced or resigned Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Tranche 2 Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement or resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Tranche 2 Letters of Credit.
(j)    Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Parent Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Tranche 2 Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Tranche 2 Loans has been accelerated, Tranche 2 Lenders with Tranche 2 LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total Tranche 2 LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Parent Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Tranche 2 Lenders, an amount in cash or provide a “back-to-back” letter of credit or alternative collateral as the Administrative Agent may approve in its sole discretion in good faith, equal to the Tranche 2 LC Exposure owing by it as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided, that the obligation of the Parent Borrower to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Parent Borrower described in Section 8.01(f). Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral so long as any Tranche 2 LC Exposure exists hereunder for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Parent Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Parent Borrower’s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank for Tranche 2 LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Parent Borrower for the Tranche 2 LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Tranche 2 Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Tranche 2 Lenders with Tranche 2 LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total Tranche 2 LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Parent Borrower under this Agreement; provided, however, that if prior to the acceleration of the maturity of the Tranche 2 Loans the Tranche 2 LC Exposure shall cease to exist, moneys in such account shall be returned to the Parent Borrower as provided below. If the Parent Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Parent Borrower within three Business Days after the earlier of (a) all Events of Default having been cured or waived or (b) the Tranche 2 LC Exposure ceasing to exist.
2.26    Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)    fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(a);

- 78 -

    

(b)    the Commitment and Outstanding Amount of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 11.01); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby;
(c)    with respect to any Tranche 2 Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender, if any Tranche 2 Swingline Exposure or Tranche 2 LC Exposure exists at the time such Tranche 2 Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i)    all or any part of the Tranche 2 Swingline Exposure and Tranche 2 LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Tranche 2 Lenders in accordance with their respective Tranche 2 Applicable Percentage but only to the extent that (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Tranche 2 Lenders’ Tranche 2 Outstanding Amounts under the Tranche 2 Commitments plus such Defaulting Lender’s Tranche 2 Swingline Exposure and Tranche 2 LC Exposure, as applicable, does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Tranche 2 Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time;
(ii)    if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Parent Borrower or the applicable Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent, (x) first, prepay such Tranche 2 Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Tranche 2 Issuing Banks only the obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s Tranche 2 LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.25 for so long as such Tranche 2 LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii)    if the Parent Borrower or another Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Tranche 2 LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Parent Borrower or such Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Tranche 2 LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s Tranche 2 LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv)    if the Tranche 2 LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.17(a) and Section 2.17(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders’ Tranche 2 Applicable Percentage;
(v)    if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Tranche 2 LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Tranche 2 Issuing Bank or any other Tranche 2 Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.17(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Tranche 2 LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Tranche 2 Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such Tranche 2 LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(d)    so long as such Tranche 2 Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Tranche 2 Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Tranche 2 Swingline Loan and no Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding Tranche 2 LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Tranche 2 Commitments of the non-Defaulting Tranche 2 Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Parent Borrower and the applicable Tranche 2 Borrower in accordance with Section 2.26, and participating interests in any newly made Tranche 2 Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Tranche 2 Letter of Credit shall be

- 79 -

    

allocated among non-Defaulting Tranche 2 Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.20 (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower and, with respect to a Tranche 2 Lender that is a Defaulting Lender, each Tranche 2 Swingline Lender and the Tranche 2 Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Tranche 2 Swingline Exposure and Tranche 2 LC Exposure of the relevant Tranche 2 Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Tranche 2 Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Tranche 2 Loans of the other Tranche 2 Lenders (other than Tranche 2 Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Tranche 2 Loans in accordance with its Tranche 2 Applicable Percentage.
2.27    Determination of U.S. Dollar Amounts. The Administrative Agent will determine the U.S. Dollar Amount of:
(a)    each Eurocurrency Rate Loan as of the date two Business Days prior to the date of such Borrowing or, if applicable, the date of conversion or continuation of any Borrowing as a Eurocurrency Rate Loan;
(b)    each Overnight Rate Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency as of the date of such Borrowing, or, if applicable, the date of conversion or continuation of any such Borrowing to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan;
(c)    the Tranche 2 LC Exposure as of the date of each request for the issuance of any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, and as of the date of any amendment of such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit that has the effect of increasing the face amount thereof; and
(d)    all outstanding Loans and the Tranche 2 LC Exposure on and as of the first Business Day of each calendar month and, during the continuation of an Event of Default, on any other Business Day elected by the Administrative Agent in its discretion or upon instruction by the Required Lenders.
Each day upon or as of which the Administrative Agent determines U.S. Dollar Amounts as described in the preceding clauses (a) through (d) is herein described as a “Computation Date” with respect to each Borrowing, Tranche 2 Letter of Credit or Tranche 2 LC Exposure for which a U.S. Dollar Amount is determined on or as of such day.

2.28    Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the “specified currency”) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which the Administrative Agent could, in accordance with normal banking procedures applicable to arm’s length transactions, purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent’s main New York City office on the Business Day immediately preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given. The obligations of the applicable Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Credit Party hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Credit Party of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Credit Party may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Credit Party in the specified currency, the applicable Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do

- 80 -

    

so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Credit Party against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Credit Party in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 2.21, such Credit Party agrees to remit such excess to such Borrower.

ARTICLE III.
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
3.01    Taxes.
(a)    Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law, provided, that if any Withholding Agent shall be required by applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then (i) the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, (ii) the applicable Withholding Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iii) if such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, an additional amount shall be paid as necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.
(b)    Payment of Other Taxes by any Loan Party. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, any Loan Party, as applicable, shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c)    Indemnification by the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on any payments made pursuant to any Loan Document or with respect to any Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest, and reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided, that no Loan Party shall be obligated to make a payment pursuant to this Section 3.01 in respect of penalties and interest attributable to or included in any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (and, for the avoidance of doubt, reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto), if (i) such penalties, interest, costs or expenses are attributable to the failure of the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as applicable, to pay amounts paid to the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as applicable, by any Loan Party (for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes) to the relevant Governmental Authority within 30 calendar days after receipt of such payment from such Loan Party or (ii) such penalties, interest, costs or expenses are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as applicable. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Parent Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Any Loan Party shall have the rights specified in Section 11.13 in respect of any Lender for whose account any Loan Party makes any payment under this Section 3.01.

- 81 -

    

(d)    Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes pursuant to this Section 3.01 by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; provided, that nothing in this Section 3.01(d) shall require such Loan Party to make available its tax returns.
(e)    Status of Lenders.
(i)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which any Loan Party is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to such Loan Party (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by any Loan Party, or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth below (but including documentation set forth in (E) below)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Loan Party is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be reasonably requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: (A) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty, (B) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI, (C) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (I) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (II) a “10 percent shareholder” of any Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (III) a “controlled foreign corporation” related to any Borrower as described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, (D) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W 8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign

- 82 -

    

Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner, and (E) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit any Loan Party to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. Each Lender that is a “U.S. person” as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Parent Borrower and Administrative Agent duly complete copies of IRS Form W-9. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall promptly update such form or certification or promptly notify the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(ii)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for any Loan Party and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (ii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(f)    Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender has determined, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly pay to such Loan Party, as applicable, an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case maybe, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided, that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to it (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
(g)    Indemnification by Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for (i) any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, only to the extent that the Loan Parties have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority and (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register. The indemnity under this Section 3.01(g) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes

- 83 -

    

so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph.
(h)    Indirect Tax. All amounts set out or expressed in a Loan Document to be payable by any party to the Administrative Agent or a Lender shall be deemed to be exclusive of any Indirect Tax. If any Indirect Tax is chargeable on any supply made by the Administrative Agent or a Lender to any party in connection with a Loan Document, that party shall pay to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (in addition to and at the same time as paying the consideration for that supply) an amount equal to the amount of the Indirect Tax, provided that an invoice or appropriate documentation that will allow the person making the payment or other relevant person to claim appropriate tax credits for the Indirect Tax so paid is provided before the Indirect Tax amount is required to be paid. Where a Loan Document requires any party to reimburse or indemnify the Administrative Agent or a Lender for any costs or expenses, that party shall also at the same time pay and indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender against all Indirect Tax incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in respect of the costs or expenses to the extent that the Administrative Agent or such Lender reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment in respect of the Indirect Tax.
3.02    Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund (a) Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in U.S. Dollars or a Foreign Currency), or (b) Overnight Rate Loans (whether denominated in U.S. Dollars or a Foreign Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the same, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, the applicable currency in the offshore interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Parent Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to (x) make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to convert ABR Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or (y) make Overnight Rate Loans, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, each Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Overnight Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars of such Lender to it to ABR Loans, and to repay all affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Overnight Rate Loans in any other currency either on the last day of the Interest Period or on the applicable Interest Payment Date, as applicable, therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Overnight Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Overnight Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Parent Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. The Parent Borrower shall have the rights in respect of any such Lender specified in Section 11.13.
3.03    Inability to Determine Rates.
(a)    If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan:
(i)    (x) if prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for any Loan for such Interest Period, or (y) at any time, that

- 84 -

    

adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR, Daily Simple RFR or RFR for Pounds Sterling or Euros,
(ii)    the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Tranche 1 Required Lenders, Tranche 2 Required Lenders, Tranche 3 Required Lenders, Tranche 4 Required Lenders, Tranche 5 Required Lenders and/or Tranche 6 Required Lenders, as the case may be, that (x) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Rate, the Eurocurrency Rate for a Tranche 1 Loan, Tranche 2 Loan, Tranche 3 Loan, Tranche 4 Loan, Tranche 5 Loan and/or Tranche 6 Loan, as the case may be, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Tranche 1 Lenders, Tranche 2 Lenders, Tranche 3 Lenders, Tranche 4 Lenders, Tranche 5 Lenders and/or Tranche 6 Lenders, as the case may be, (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans, as applicable, during such Interest Period, or or (y) at any time, the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for Pounds Sterling or Euros will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for Pounds Sterling or Euros, or
(iii)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that deposits in the applicable Foreign Currency are not generally available in the applicable market;
the Administrative Agent shall give facsimile or e-mail notice thereof to the applicable Tranche 1 Borrowers, Tranche 2 Borrowers, Tranche 3 Borrowers, Tranche 4 Borrowers, Tranche 5 Borrowers and/or Tranche 6 Borrowers, as applicable, and the relevant Lenders, as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 3.03(a) (x) (A) any Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars and requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, with respect to Tranche 1 Loans, Tranche 2 Loans, Tranche 3 Loans, Tranche 4 Loans, Tranche 5 Loans and/or Tranche 6 Loans, as applicable, and (B) any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be at the Alternate Rate, with respect to Tranche 1 Loans, Tranche 2 Loans, Tranche 3 Loans, Tranche 4 Loans, Tranche 5 Loans and/or Tranche 6 Loans, as applicable (y) any Loans that are denominated in U.S. Dollars and were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans, with respect to Tranche 1 Loans, Tranche 2 Loans, Tranche 3 Loans, Tranche 4 Loans, Tranche 5 Loans and/or Tranche 6 Loans, as applicable, and (z) (A) any outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans, if denominated in U.S. Dollars, shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans, with respect to Tranche 1 Loans, Tranche 2 Loans, Tranche 3 Loans, Tranche 4 Loans, Tranche 5 Loans and/or Tranche 6 Loans, as applicable, and (B) any outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans that are not denominated in U.S. Dollars shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to the Alternate Rate, with respect to Tranche 1 Loans, Tranche 2 Loans, Tranche 3 Loans, Tranche 4 Loans, Tranche 5 Loans and/or Tranche 6 Loans, as applicable. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (which notification shall be made promptly after the Administrative Agent obtains knowledge of the cessation of the circumstances referenced in clause (i) or receives notice from the Tranche 1 Required Lenders, Tranche 2 Required Lenders, Tranche 3 Required Lenders, Tranche 4 Required Lenders, Tranche 5 Required Lenders and/or Tranche 6 Required Lenders, as applicable, of the cessation of the circumstances referenced in this clause (ii)), no further Eurocurrency Rate Loans with respect to Tranche 1 Loans, Tranche 2 Loans, Tranche 3 Loans, Tranche 4 Loans, Tranche 5 Loans and/or Tranche 6 Loans, as applicable, shall be made or continued as such, nor shall any Tranche 1 Borrower, Tranche 2 Borrower, Tranche 3 Borrower, Tranche 4 Borrower, Tranche 5 Borrower and/or Tranche 6 Borrower, as applicable, have the right to convert Tranche 1 Loans, Tranche 2 Loans, Tranche 3 Loans, Tranche 4 Loans, Tranche 5 Loans and/or Tranche 6 Loans, as applicable, to Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If such notice is given pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 3.03(a), any Eurocurrency Loans in the

- 85 -

    

affected Foreign Currency requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall not be made.

(b)    If at any time the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) the circumstances set forth in clause (a)(i) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances set forth in clause (a)(i) have not arisen but either (w) the supervisor for the administrator of the Euorcurrency ScreenEurocurrency Rate has made a public statement that the administrator of the Eurocurrency Screen Rate is insolvent (and there is no successor administrator that will continue publication of the Eurocurrency Screen Rate), (x) the administrator of the Eurocurrency Screen Rate has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Eurocurrency Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely cease to be published by it (and there is no successor administrator that will continue publication of the Eurocurrency Screen Rate), (y) the supervisor for the administrator of the Eurocurrency Screen Rate has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Eurocurrency Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely cease to be published or (z) the supervisor for the administrator of the Eurocurrency Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Eurocurrency Screen Rate may no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower shall endeavor to establish an alternate rate of interest for each of the applicable currencies to the Eurocurrency Rate that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for each of the applicable currencies for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable (but for the avoidance of doubt, such related changes shall not include a reduction of the Applicable Rate); provided, that if such alternate rates of interest as so determined would be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 11.01, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date such amendment is provided to the Tranche 1 Lenders, Tranche 2 Lenders, Tranche 3 Lenders, Tranche 4 Lenders, Tranche 5 Lenders and/or Tranche 6 Lenders, as the case may be, a written notice from the Tranche 1 Required Lenders, Tranche 2 Required Lenders, Tranche 3 Required Lenders, Tranche 4 Required Lenders, Tranche 5 Required Lenders and/or Tranche 6 Required Lenders, as the case may be, stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this clause (b) (but, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 3.03(b), only to the extent the Eurocurrency Screen Rate for the applicable currency and such Interest Period is not available or published at such time on a current basis), in the case of any Borrowing to the U.S. Borrowers and denominated in U.S. Dollars (x) any request to convert a Committed Loan Borrowing to, or continuation of any such Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or RFR Loans shall be ineffective and (y) if any Borrower requests a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, such Borrowing shall be made, in the case of such Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars to the U.S. Borrowers, as an ABR Loan, and in the case of Borrowings to a Foreign Borrower, or, if not denominated in U.S. Dollars, any other such Borrower, such Borrowings shall bear interest at the Alternate Rate. For purposes of this Section 3.03(b), the terms “Eurocurrency Screen Rate” and “Eurocurrency Rate” shall be deemed to include the EURIBOR Screen Rate, the CDOR Screen Rate, and the AUD Screen Rate.
(c)    Unavailability of AUD Screen Rate.
(i)    If the AUD Screen Rate is not available for the Interest Period of a Tranche 4 Loan, the AUD Screen Rate shall be the Interpolated Rate for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of such Loan, except where the Interest Period is less than the shortest

- 86 -

    

period published for the AUD Screen Rate, in which case it will be the AUD Screen Rate for the shortest period published for the AUD Screen Rate.
(ii)    If the AUD Screen Rate is not available for the currency of a Tranche 4 Loan or the Interest Period of a Tranche 4 Loan and it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Rate, the applicable AUD Screen Rate shall be the Reference Bank Rate as of 11:00 a.m. Sydney time and for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of such Tranche 4 Loan.
(iii)    If paragraph (ii) above applies but no Reference Bank Rate is available for the relevant currency and Interest Period there shall be no AUD Screen Rate for such Tranche 4 Loan and paragraph (iv) shall apply to that Loan for that Interest Period.
(iv)    If this paragraph (iv) applies, the rate of interest on each Tranche 4 Lender's share of the Tranche 4 Loan for the relevant Interest Period shall be the percentage rate per annum which is the sum of the Applicable Rate and the rate of interest notified to the Administrative Agent by the such Tranche 4 Lender to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum, the cost to the such Lender of funding its participation in such Tranche 4 Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select. That rate is to be notified as soon as practicable and in any event within five Business Days of the first day of that Interest Period.
(v)    If paragraph (iv) applies and the Administrative Agent or the Parent Borrower so requires, the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than 30 days) with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest.
(vi)    Any alternative basis agreed pursuant to paragraph (iv) above shall, with the prior consent of all Tranche 4 Lenders and the Parent Borrower, be binding on all parties to this Agreement.
(vii)    If paragraph (iv) applies, but any Tranche 4 Lender does not supply a quotation by the time specified in paragraph (iv) above, the rate of interest for that Tranche 4 Lender shall be calculated on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Lenders.
(d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if an Early Opt-in Election has occurred, a forward-looking term rate based on SOFR selected by the Administrative Agent will replace the Eurocurrency Rate for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of existing U.S. Dollar denominated Eurocurrency Rate Loans and subsequent U.S. Dollar denominated Eurocurrency Rate Loans and the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect the fallback to such term SOFR based rate and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable (but for the avoidance of doubt, such related changes shall not include a reduction of the Applicable Rate). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 11.01, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date such amendment is provided to the Tranche 1 Lenders, Tranche 2 Lenders, Tranche 3 Lenders, Tranche 4 Lenders, Tranche 5 Lenders and/or Tranche 6 Lenders, as the case may be, a written notice from the Tranche 1 Required Lenders, Tranche 2 Required Lenders, Tranche 3 Required Lenders, Tranche 4 Required Lenders, Tranche 5 Required Lenders and/or Tranche 6 Required Lenders, as the case may be, stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.

3.04    Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans.

(a)    Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e)); (ii) subject the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Overnight Rate Loan made by it or any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit or participation therein, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender); or (iii) impose on any Lender or any Tranche 2 Issuing Bank or any offshore interbank market applicable to any Foreign Currency any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Overnight Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender accompanied by a certificate required by subsection (c) below, the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided, that any such amount or amounts shall not be duplicative of any amounts to the extent otherwise paid by such Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement. Each Borrower shall have the rights specified in Section 11.13 in respect of any Lender for whose account such Borrower makes any payment under this Section 3.04.
(b)    Capital Requirements. If any Lender or Tranche 2 Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by any Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time, upon request of such Lender accompanied by a certificate required by subsection (c) below, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)    Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 3.04 and delivered to a Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such Lender shall also certify that it is generally charging such costs to similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 3.04 after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant, which determination shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis). The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.
(d)    Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a

- 88 -

    

waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided, that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies such Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
(e)    Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Overnight Rate Loans. Each applicable Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as “Eurocurrency liabilities”), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan and/or Overnight Rate Loan made to it equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; provided, that such Borrower shall have received at least 10 days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.
3.05    Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, each applicable Borrower shall, within 30 days following request of such Lender (accompanied by a certificate described below), compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense (excluding lost profits) incurred by it as a result of: (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan made to it other than an ABR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); (b) any failure by it (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than an ABR Loan on the date or in the amount notified by it; or (c) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by it pursuant to Section 11.13. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by a Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other Borrowing in the offshore interbank market applicable to such Foreign Currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower.  The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. No Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any loss, cost or expense incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies such Borrower of such loss, cost and expense and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor.
3.06    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a)    Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or a Borrower is required to pay (or will be required to pay) any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i)

- 89 -

    

would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04 as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment within 30 days following request of such Lender.
(b)    Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if a Borrower is required to pay (or will be required to pay) any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, the Parent Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 11.13.
3.07    Survival. Each Loan Party’s obligations under this Article III shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the termination of the Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.
3.08    Tranche 2 Issuing Bank. Each Tranche 2 Issuing Bank shall be deemed to be a Lender for purposes of this Article III.

Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions, and such Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their respective directors and officers and, to the knowledge of such Borrower, its employees and agents, are in compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions in all material respects.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Parent Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 8.02 and 11.01) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Parent Borrower or a Lender.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Parent Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
9.05    Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.

The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any

- 109 -

    

such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
9.06    Resignation of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, each Tranche 2 Issuing Bank and the Parent Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Parent Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld) unless an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a) or Section 8.01(f) shall have occurred and be continuing, to appoint a successor, which shall be a Lender with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such Lender with an office in the United States. Such successor Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Parent Borrower duly completed IRS Form W-8, W-9, or other applicable IRS forms. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 45 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and each Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section 9.06). The fees payable by the Parent Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Parent Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
9.07    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and Other Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
9.08    No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers, Syndication Agents or Documentation Agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement, a Tranche 2 Issuing Bank, or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. The Lenders are not partners or

- 110 -

    

co-venturers, and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in case of the Administrative Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender.
9.09    Posting of Communications.
(a)    Each Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make any Communications available to the Lenders and the Tranche 2 Issuing Banks by posting the Communications on IntraLinks™, DebtDomain, SyndTrak, ClearPar or any other electronic platform chosen by the Administrative Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the “Approved Electronic Platform”).
(b)    Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified by the Administrative Agent from time to time (including, as of the Closing Date, a user ID/password authorization system) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lenders, each of the Tranche 2 Issuing Banks and each of the Borrowers acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure, that the Administrative Agent is not responsible for approving or vetting the representatives or contacts of any Lender that are added to the Approved Electronic Platform, and that there may be confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. Each of the Lenders, each of the Tranche 2 Issuing Banks and the Parent Borrower hereby approves distribution of the Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution.
(c)    THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. THE APPLICABLE PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS, OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE APPLICABLE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY LOAN PARTY, ANY LENDER, ANY TRANCHE 2 ISSUING BANK OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF ANY LOAN PARTY’S OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT’S TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM.
“Communications” means, collectively, any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material provided by or on behalf of any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated therein which is distributed by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Tranche 2 Issuing Bank by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section, including through an Approved Electronic Platform.
(d)    Each Lender and each Tranche 2 Issuing Bank agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that Communications have been posted to the Approved Electronic Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such

- 111 -

    

Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender and Tranche 2 Issuing Bank agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (which could be in the form of electronic communication) from time to time of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s (as applicable) email address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such email address.
(e)    Each of the Lenders, each Tranche 2 Issuing Bank and the Parent Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but (except as may be required by applicable law) shall not be obligated to, store the Communications on the Approved Electronic Platform in accordance with the Administrative Agent’s generally applicable document retention procedures and policies.
(f)    Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Tranche 2 Issuing Bank to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document.
9.10    ERISA Matters(a)    . (a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Loan Party, that at least one of the following is and will be true:

Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Loan Party, that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).
ARTICLE X.    
GUARANTY
10.01    Guarantee. In order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to execute and deliver this Agreement and to make or maintain the Loans, and in consideration thereof, the Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, the prompt and complete payment and performance by the Designated Borrowers when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations, and the Guarantor further agrees to pay any and all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) which may be paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or by the Lenders in enforcing, or obtaining advice of counsel in respect of, any of their rights under the guarantee contained in this Article X. The Guarantor undertakes to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders that if an Ipso Facto Event has occurred, then immediately on demand by the Administrative Agent with the consent of, or at the request of, the Required Lenders (provided that the Administrative Agent may only make such a demand under this Section if it could, but for the Ipso Facto Event, have made that demand against the relevant Designated Borrower pursuant to Section 8.02 (Remedies Upon Event of Default) the Guarantor shall pay all Loans, accrued interest and other amounts referred to in Section 8.02 as if it were the principal obligor. The guarantee contained in this Article X, subject to Section 10.05, shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time prior thereto such Designated Borrower may be free from any Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt and without any implication to the contrary, the guarantee by the Guarantor and all waivers, acknowledgments and agreement by the Guarantor contained in this Article X shall be limited solely to the Obligations of the Designated Borrowers.
The Guarantor agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of its liability under this Article X, it will notify the Administrative Agent and such Lender in writing that such payment is made under the guarantee contained in this Article X for such purpose. No payment or payments made by any Designated Borrower or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from any Designated Borrower or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any setoff or appropriation or application, at any time or from time to time, in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of the Guarantor under this Article X which, notwithstanding any such payment or payments, shall remain liable for the unpaid and outstanding Obligations until, subject to Section 10.05, the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated.
“Ipso Facto Event” means a Designated Borrower is the subject of:

- 113 -

    

(a)    an announcement, application, compromise, arrangement, managing controller, or administration as described in section 415D(1), 434J(1) or 451E(1) of the Australian Corporations Act; or
(b)    any process which under any law with a similar purpose may give rise to a stay on, or prevention of, the exercise of contractual rights.
10.02    No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by the Guarantor pursuant to this Article X or any set-off or application of funds of the Guarantor by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the guarantee contained in this Article X, the Guarantor shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Designated Borrower or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations, nor shall the Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from such Designated Borrower in respect of payments made by such Guarantor under this Article X, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders on account of the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by the Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of the Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by the Guarantor (duly indorsed by the Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine. The provisions of this Section 10.02 shall survive the term of the guarantee contained in this Article X and the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Commitments and this Agreement.
10.03    Amendments, etc. with respect to the Obligations. The Guarantor shall remain obligated under this Article X notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against the Guarantor, and without notice to or further assent by the Guarantor, any demand for payment of or reduction in the principal amount of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and any of the Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and this Agreement and any other documents executed and delivered in connection herewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Lenders (or the Required Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for the guarantee contained in this Article X or any property subject thereto.
10.04    Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. The Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the guarantee contained in this Article X or acceptance of the guarantee contained in this Article X; the Obligations shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Article X; and all dealings between any Designated Borrower or the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Article X. Each Guarantor

- 114 -

    

waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Guarantor or any Designated Borrower with respect to the Obligations. To the full extent permitted by law, the guarantee contained in this Article X shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) the legality under applicable Laws of repayment by any Designated Borrower of the Obligations or the adoption of any requirement of law purporting to render any Obligations null and void, (c) any defense, setoff or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance by a Designated Borrower) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Guarantor against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (d) any change in ownership of any Designated Borrower, any merger or consolidation of any Designated Borrower into another Person or any loss of any Designated Borrower’s separate legal identity or existence, or (e) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of any Designated Borrower or the Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of any Obligations, or of the Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Article X in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When the Administrative Agent or any Lender is pursuing its rights and remedies under this Article X against the Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against any Designated Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from any Designated Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of any Designated Borrower or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve the Parent Borrower of any liability under this Article X and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against the Guarantor.
10.05    Reinstatement. The guarantee contained in this Article X shall continue to be effective, or be automatically reinstated without further action, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of such Designated Borrower or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, such Designated Borrower or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
10.06    Payments. The Guarantor hereby agrees that any payments in respect of the Obligations pursuant to this Article X will be paid to the Administrative Agent without setoff or counterclaim in U.S. Dollars, at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in Section 11.02.
10.07    Independent Obligations. The obligations of the Guarantor under the guarantee contained in Article X are independent of the obligations of the Parent Borrower, in its capacity as such, or any Designated Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor whether or not the Parent Borrower, in its capacity as such, or such Designated Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. The Guarantor waives, to the full extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof. Any payment by the Parent Borrower or a Designated Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to the Parent Borrower or such Designated Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to such Guarantor.

(d)    Participations. Any Lender may at any time sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Parent Borrower or any of the Parent Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, each Tranche 2 Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly, with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.

Subject to subsection (e) of this Section 11.06, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.21 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided, that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or Section 1.163-5(b) of the United States Treasury Regulations (or, in each case, any amended or successor versions). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
(e)    Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Parent Borrower’s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Parent Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant

- 123 -

    

and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender.
(f)    Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other relevant central bank; provided, that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(g)    Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of any Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness.

11.10    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.

11.13    Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if any Borrower is required to pay (or will be required to pay) any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 or if any Lender determines pursuant to Section 3.02 that it is not permitted to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender declines to approve any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement or any Loan Document that requires approval of all Lenders pursuant to Section 11.01 or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives any Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Parent Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided, that: (a) a Borrower or the applicable assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 11.06(b); (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in Tranche 2 LC Disbursements and Tranche 2 Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or a Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); and (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling a Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
