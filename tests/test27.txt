(c)                BCSF may expend funds by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof in order to fund an existing Investment, avoid or cure any immediate borrowing base deficiency, default or event of default or termination event related to indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary or to otherwise avert or mitigate significant immediate damage to the Company (such expenditure, “Emergency Funding”); provided, that in each case BCSF or the Administrative Agent determines in good faith and on a reasonable basis that (i) such expenditure directly relates to a sudden or unexpected event, (ii) such expenditure needs to be made within 36 hours of the Administrative Agent becoming aware of such expenditure and it is not reasonably practicable to obtain Prior Committee Approval prior to making such expenditure, (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries has insufficient available cash to make such expenditure, (iv) the failure to make such expenditure would reasonably be expected to adversely affect one or more Investments in any material respect, and (v) after giving effect to such expenditure, the total amount of all Emergency Funding outstanding at such time does not exceed $25,000,000. The Members agree that any Emergency Funding shall be treated as a Capital Contribution for all purposes of this Agreement and shall not accrue any interest or entitle BCSF to any fees or the like; provided, that in no event shall any Emergency Funding affect any Proportionate Share or any rights related thereto or derived therefrom (including the rights to vote, receive distributions or be allocated Profit or Loss) except as set forth in Section 5.1(b)(i).

Section 3.3               Defaulting Members.

 

(a)                Upon the failure of any Member (a “Defaulting Member”) to pay in full any portion of such Member’s Capital Commitment within ten (10) Business Days after written notice from any other Member that such payment is overdue (the “Default Date”), any other Member, in its sole discretion, shall have the right to pursue one or more of the following remedies on behalf of the Company, with respect to sub-clauses (i) and (ii), or directly, with respect to sub-clauses (iii) and (iv), if such failure has not been cured in full within such ten (10) Business Day period:

 

(i)                 seek to collect such unpaid portion (and all attorneys’ fees and other costs incident thereto) by exercising or pursuing any legal remedy the Company may have;

 

(ii)               upon ten (10) Business Days’ written notice to the other Members (which period may commence during the ten (10) Business Day notice period provided above), and provided that the overdue payment has not been made, dissolve and wind down the Company in accordance with Article 8;

 

(iii)             so long as it is not also a Defaulting Member, compel the Defaulting Member to sell or transfer the Defaulting Member’s Entire Interest and all of such Defaulting Member’s Subordinated Notes at the price and in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8.3(e); and

 

(iv)              so long as it is not also a Defaulting Member, fund all or any portion of the defaulted amount on behalf of the Defaulting Member with notice to the Administrative Agent and the other Members; provided, that the Members hereby agree and acknowledge (A) that any amount so funded shall be treated as a loan to the Defaulting Member (a “Default Loan”) by the other Member (the “Loan Holder”), the proceeds of which are used by the Defaulting Member to make a Capital Contribution to the Company which, if in amount, may cure a related default by such Defaulting Member; (B) a Default Loan (together with all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by the Loan Holder in connection making such Default Loan, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, which shall be added to the principal of any Default Loan if and when incurred) shall (I) bear interest from the date of such funding until repaid by the Defaulting Member at a rate equal to 10% per annum, compounded annually, (II) be pre-payable by the Defaulting Member at any time, and (III) be fully recourse to the Defaulting Member; (C) until such time that there is no outstanding balance owed under any Default Loan (including any accrued interest thereon), (x) any amounts that would otherwise be distributable to the Defaulting Member under Section 5.1 or Section 8.3(d) shall instead be distributed to the Loan Holder and (y) any purchase price payable to the Defaulting Member in connection with any sale of its interests in the Company shall first be paid to the Loan Holder and in each case of sub-clauses (x) and (y), as repayment of the Default Loan(s) until the repayment in full of such Default Loan(s) (and accrued interest thereon) proportionate to the amount of Default Loan(s) so extended by the Loan Holder to such Defaulting Member; and (D) any amounts distributed to the Loan Holder pursuant to the previous sentence shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes as having been made by the Company to the Defaulting Member, notwithstanding the Company’s distribution of such amounts to the Loan Holder, and any amounts distributed or payable to the Loan Holder pursuant to the previous sentence shall reduce the amounts owed to the Loan Holder under the related Default Loan, first as to interest and then as to principal.

 

10
 

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.3(b), the non-Defaulting Member’s election to pursue any one of such remedies shall not be deemed to preclude such Member from pursuing any other such remedy, or any other available remedy, simultaneously or subsequently.

 

(b)                Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i)                 a Defaulting Member shall not be entitled to distributions made after the Default Date until the default is cured and any such distributions to which such Defaulting Member would otherwise have been entitled if such default had not occurred shall be debited against the Capital Account of the Defaulting Member so as to reduce the remaining amount of the default; and

 

(ii)               the Company shall not make new Investments after the Default Date until the default is cured.

 

Section 3.4               Interest or Withdrawals. No Member shall be entitled to receive any interest on any Capital Contribution to the Company (except as otherwise specifically contemplated by the Subordinated Note or set forth herein). Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, no Member shall be entitled to withdraw any part of its Capital Contributions or Capital Account balance.

 

Section 3.5               Admission of Additional Members.

 

(a)                The Members (acting through the Committee) may (i) admit additional Members upon terms approved by Prior Committee Approval, (ii) permit existing Members to subscribe for additional interests in the Company and increase their respective Capital Commitments and (iii) admit a substitute Member in accordance with Section 7.1.

 

(b)                Each additional Member shall execute and deliver a written instrument satisfactory to the existing Members whereby such Member becomes a party to this Agreement, as well as any other documents reasonably required by the Members (acting through the Committee). Each such additional Member shall thereafter be entitled to all the rights and subject to all the obligations of Members as set forth herein. Upon the admission of or the increase in the interest of any Member as herein provided, the Administrative Agent shall update the Member List to reflect such admission or increase.

 

ARTICLE 4
ALLOCATIONS

 

Section 4.1               Capital Accounts.

 

(a)                A Capital Account shall be maintained for each Member consisting of such Member’s Capital Contributions, increased or decreased by Profit or Loss allocated to such Member, decreased by the cash or Value of property distributed to such Member (giving net effect to any liabilities the property is subject to, or which the Member assumes), and otherwise maintained consistent with this Agreement. In the event that the Administrative Agent determines that it is prudent to modify the manner in which Capital Accounts, including all debits and credits thereto, are computed in order to be maintained consistent with this Agreement, including to take into account reserves, if needed, as contemplated by Section 8.3(d), the Administrative Agent is authorized to make such modifications to the extent that they do not result in a material adverse effect to any Member. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, Capital Accounts shall be maintained in a manner consistent with the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.

 

11
 

 

(b)                Profit or Loss shall be allocated among Members as of the end of each fiscal year of the Company; provided that Profit or Loss shall also be allocated at the end of (i) each period terminating on the date of any withdrawal by any Member, (ii) each period terminating immediately before the date of any admission or increase in Capital Commitment of any Member, (iii) the liquidation of the Company, or (iv) any period which is determined by the Members (acting through the Committee) to be appropriate. Organization Costs shall be amortized over four (4) years or such other period deemed appropriate by the Members (acting through the Committee).

 

Section 4.2               Allocations.

 

(a)                Profit or Loss for each fiscal year shall be allocated among the Members in a manner such that, as of the end of such fiscal year and taking into account all prior allocations of Profit or Loss of the Company and all distributions made by the Company through such date, the Capital Account of each Member is, as nearly as possible, equal to the distributions that would be made to such Member if the Company were dissolved, its affairs wound up and assets sold for cash equal to their book value, all the Company liabilities were satisfied (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the adjusted tax basis of the assets securing such liability), and the net assets of the Company were distributed immediately after such allocation.

 

(b)                Regulatory Allocations. In the event any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5) or 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6) of the Treasury Regulations, items of income (including gross income) and gain shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate the deficit balance in such Member’s Capital Account (in excess of (i) the amount such Member is obligated to restore upon liquidation of the Company or upon liquidation of such Member’s interest in the Company and (ii) such Member’s share of the Minimum Gain (as defined in Section 1.704-2 of the Treasury Regulations)) created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible. Additionally, there are hereby incorporated herein such special allocation provisions governing the allocation of income, deduction, gain, and loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as may be necessary under, and in the manner required by, the Treasury Regulations to ensure that this Schedule complies with all requirements of Section 1.704-2 of the Treasury Regulations relating to “minimum gain” and “partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain” and the allocation and chargeback of so-called “nonrecourse deductions” and “partner nonrecourse deductions”, including a “qualified income offset”.

 

Section 4.3               Changes of Interests. For purposes of allocating Profit or Loss for any fiscal year or other fiscal period between any permitted transferor and transferee of a Company interest, or between any Members whose relative Company interests have changed during such period, or to any withdrawing Member that is no longer a Member in the Company, the Company shall allocate according to any method allowed by the Code and selected by the Members (acting through the Committee). Distributions with respect to an interest in the Company shall be payable to the owner of such interest on the date of distribution. For purposes of determining the Profit or Loss allocable to or the distributions payable to a permitted transferee of an interest in the Company or to a Member whose interest has otherwise increased or decreased, Profit or Loss allocations and distributions made to predecessor owners with respect to such transferred interest or increase of interest shall be deemed allocated and made to the permitted transferee or other holder.

 

12
 

 

Section 4.4               Tax Matters.

 

(a)                The Company shall be properly classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and neither the Company nor any Member shall elect to treat the Company as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each Subsidiary shall be properly classified as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the Company shall not elect to treat any such Subsidiary as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 

(b)                Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit determined in accordance with the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations shall be allocated in the same manner as such item is allocated pursuant to Section 4.2 or Section 4.3, as appropriate.

 

(c)                The allocation methodology set forth in this Article 4 is intended to comply with certain requirements of the Treasury Regulations. In the event of any variation between the adjusted tax basis and value of any Company property reflected in the Members’ Capital Accounts maintained for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such variation shall be taken into account in allocating taxable income or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with, and to the extent consistent with, the principles under Section 704 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations; provided, however, that the Company shall utilize the “traditional method” provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(b) with respect to the property contributed or deemed contributed to the Company by any Member on or about the Effective Date. A decision to use a method to allocate such variation pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3, other than as described above, shall be considered a tax election requiring Prior Committee Approval.

 

(d)                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Code or Treasury Regulations require an adjustment to be made to a Capital Account of a Member, or some other event or events occurs or occur necessitating or justifying, in the Members’ judgment, an adjustment deemed equitable to the Members, the Members (acting through the Committee) shall make such adjustment in the determination and allocation among the Members of Capital Accounts, or items of income, deduction, gain, or loss for tax purposes, accounting procedures or such other financial or tax items as shall equitably take into account such event and applicable provisions of law, and the determination thereof in the sole discretion of the Members (acting through the Committee) shall be final and conclusive as to all of the Members.

 

(e)                Each Member and the Company agrees to treat the membership interests in the Company, together with the Subordinated Notes, as a single interest constituting equity in the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 

(f)                 If the Company determines that it has invested (directly or indirectly) in a “passive foreign investment company” within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code (a “PFIC”), the Company shall notify each Member of such determination. With respect to each PFIC, for each fiscal year of the Company commencing with the first fiscal year of the Company in which the Company determined that such entity was a PFIC, the Company (i) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Member, upon request, within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company in which such Member holds (directly or indirectly) an interest in such PFIC, with (A) all information in the Company’s possession or reasonably obtainable by the Company without undue burden or expense reasonably necessary to permit such Member (or the beneficial owners of such Member, as applicable) to complete IRS Form 8621 with respect to such PFIC, and (B) a “PFIC Annual Information Statement” prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1295-1(g) with respect to such PFIC; and (ii) shall timely make and maintain a “qualified electing fund” election within the meaning of Section 1295 of the Code with respect to such PFIC, unless the Members (acting through the Committee) reasonably determine that it is in the best interest of the Company not to make such election.

 

13
 

 

(g)                The Company shall seek to take all necessary steps prescribed by Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any Treasury Regulations, rules or guidance issued thereunder, and any laws, rules, guidance or other requirements relating to an applicable intergovernmental agreement (collectively, “FATCA”) to avoid any withholding tax on distributions to the Company and to any Members under such provisions. Furthermore, the Company agrees that prior to taking any of the actions outlined in this Section 4.4(g) with respect to a Member’s failure to timely comply with its FATCA-related obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall provide such Member with written notice of such non-compliance and a reasonable opportunity to cure any such failure.

(a)                Unless otherwise determined by Prior Committee Approval, the Company shall distribute to the Members all Available Cash promptly following receipt thereof in no event less frequently than quarterly. The Company may also distribute assets of the Company with Prior Committee Approval and subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(b). Distributions made to the Members pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) shall be made in accordance with Section 5.1(b), Section 5.1(c) and Section 5.1(d) below; provided that the amount of any such distribution may be reduced as provided by Section 5.2 and Section 5.3.

 

(b)                Available Cash derived from Investment Income shall be distributed to the Members as follows:

 

(i)                 100% to BCSF until any outstanding Emergency Funding is repaid; and then

 

(ii)               100% to the Subordinated Notes pro rata based on the total amount of the Subordinated Notes then outstanding until such time as Amberstone’s Subordinated Notes have received all Subordinated Note Interest due and payable as of the date of such distribution under the Subordinated Notes, including any penalties thereon; and then

 

(iii)             100% to the Class A Preferred Interests, until the Class A Preferred Interests have received an amount equal to 15% of Available Cash derived from Investment Income; and thereafter

 

(iv)              100% to the Class B Interests pro rata in accordance with the Member’s respective Class B Interests.

 

(c)                Available Cash derived from Capital Gains shall be distributed to the Members as follows:

 

(i)                 100% to BCSF until any outstanding Emergency Funding is repaid; and then

 

(ii)               100% to the Subordinated Notes pro rata based on the total amount of the Subordinated Notes then outstanding until such time as Amberstone’s Subordinated Notes have received all Subordinated Note Interest due and payable as of the date of such distribution, including any penalties thereon, taking into account all amounts paid in Section 5.1(b)(ii); and then

 

14
 

 

(iii)             100% to the Class A Preferred Interests, until the Class A Preferred Interests have received the lower of an amount equal to 15% of (A) Available Cash derived from Capital Gains received in such quarter or (B) Available Cash derived from Year-to-Date Capital Gains; and thereafter

 

(iv)              100% to the Class B Interests pro rata in accordance with the Member’s respective Class B Interests.

 

(d)                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, (x) if any Member is in default in its obligation to make Capital Contributions or to reimburse the Company for any amounts as and when such Capital Contributions are required to be made or amounts are required to be reimbursed, as applicable, distributions pursuant to Section 5.1(b) and Section 5.1(c) shall be withheld and applied against such Capital Contributions or reimbursement obligations and treated for all purposes hereof as having been distributed to such Member and contributed to the Company as a Capital Contribution or paid to the Company as a reimbursement, as applicable, and (y)to the extent any amounts are owed by a Defaulting Member to a Loan Holder under a Default Loan, any amounts that would otherwise be distributable to the Defaulting Member under Sections 5.1(b)(ii) and (iv) or Sections 5.1(c)(ii) and (iv) shall instead be distributed to the Loan Holder pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3(a)(iv).

 

Section 5.2               Withholding. The Company may withhold from any distribution to any Member any amount which the Company has paid or is obligated to pay in respect of any withholding or other foreign, U.S. federal, state or local tax, including any interest, penalties or additions with respect thereto (a “Withholding Payment”), imposed on any interest or income of or distributions to such Member, and such withheld amount shall be considered a distribution to such Member for purposes hereof. If no payment is then being made to such Member in an amount sufficient to pay the Company’s withholding obligation, any amount which the Company is obligated to pay shall be deemed an interest-free advance from the Company to such Member, payable by such Member by withholding from subsequent distributions or within seven (7) Business Days after receiving written request for payment from the Company. If the proceeds to the Company from an Investment are reduced on account of taxes withheld by any other Person (such as an entity in which the Company owns an interest, directly or indirectly), and such taxes are imposed on or otherwise are attributable to one or more Members, the amount of the reduction shall be treated as if it were paid by the Company as a Withholding Payment with respect to the relevant Member. Each Member hereby agrees to indemnify the Company for, and hold the Company harmless from, any Withholding Payment that is attributable to such Member (as reasonably determined by the Members (acting through the Committee)), including any interest, penalties and additions to tax with respect thereto. The obligations set forth in this Section 5.2 shall survive a Member’s ceasing to be a Member of the Company, the termination, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company and the termination of this Agreement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain on behalf of each Member any available exemption from, reduction in, or refund of withholding or other taxes imposed on such Member (or any beneficial owner of such Member) in connection with income or distributions from the Company or otherwise provide a Member, at such Member’s expense, with reasonable assistance and such reasonably available information as may be required by such Member (or any beneficial owner of such Member) to itself obtain any such available exemption, reduction or refund.

 

15
 

 

Section 5.3               Certain Limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions:

 

(a)                In no event shall the Company make a distribution to the extent that it would violate Section 18-607(a) of the Act or other applicable law.

 

(b)                Distributions shall be made in cash or, in the sole discretion of the Members (with Prior Committee Approval), in-kind in such Company assets as may be selected by the Members (with Prior Committee Approval) in their sole discretion. The value of any asset distributed in-kind shall equal the fair market value of such asset on the date of distribution as determined by Prior Committee Approval; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to distribute the same Company assets to each Member in any in-kind distribution. Securities listed on a national securities exchange that are not restricted as to transferability and unlisted securities for which an active trading market exists and that are not restricted as to transferability shall be valued in the manner contemplated by Section 9.5 as of the close of business on the day preceding the distribution, and all other securities and non-cash assets shall be valued as determined in the last valuation made pursuant to Section 9.5.

(a)                At all meetings of the Committee, the presence of at least two (2) Member Designees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, provided that at least one (1) Member Designee is present that was elected, designated or appointed by each of BCSF and Amberstone.

Section 6.6               Electronic Communications. Member Designees may participate in meetings of the Committee by means of telephone or video conference, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting to the extent permissible by applicable law.

Section 6.10            Reliance by Third Parties. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any contract, instrument or act on behalf of the Company by an officer or any other Person delegated by Prior Committee Approval shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any third party dealing with the Company that such Person has the authority, power and right to execute and deliver such contract or instrument and to take such act on behalf of the Company.

(a)                No Member or Member Designee shall be required to devote any fixed portion of its time to the activities and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, that each of BCSF and Amberstone shall devote such time and effort as is reasonably necessary to diligently conduct the activities and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b)                The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates manage, advise or administer other investment funds and other accounts and may manage, advise or administer additional funds and other accounts in the future, some of which may have similar mandates as the Company. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates are subject to the provisions of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and the rules, regulations and interpretations thereof, with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities among such other investment funds and other accounts and the Company. Except for any obligations under the Advisers Act, neither the Administrative Agent nor its Affiliates shall be obligated to offer any investment opportunity, or portion thereof, to the Company.

 

18
 

 

(c)                Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each of the Members, the Administrative Agent and each of their respective Affiliates and members may engage in, invest in, participate in or otherwise enter into other business ventures of any kind, nature and description, individually and with others, including the formation and management of other investment funds, with or without the same or similar purposes as the Company, and the ownership of and investment in securities, and neither the Company nor any other Member shall have any right in or to any such activities or the income or profits derived therefrom. In connection therewith, it is expressly agreed that, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, in no event shall it be considered a violation of this Agreement (whether under Section 6.11(a) with respect to time devotion or under any other section herein with respect to investment allocations or otherwise) for a Member or any of its Affiliates or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to continue to engage in such investments and transactions nor shall the provisions of this Agreement in any way limit or prohibit any future investments or transactions by a Member or any of its Affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents directly or with third parties or in any way constrain the ability of a Member or any of its Affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to manage and invest their assets.

 

(d)                No Member, in its capacity as Member of the Company, shall owe any duty (including any fiduciary duty) to the Company, to any other Member or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, members, partners, shareholders, employees or agents of any of the foregoing, or any of their respective heirs, successors or assigns (other than the duty of good faith and fair dealing).

 

Section 6.12            Indemnification.

 

(a)                Subject to the limitations and conditions as provided in this Section 6.12, each Person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or arbitrative or in the nature of an alternative dispute resolution in lieu of any of the foregoing (hereinafter a “Proceeding”), or any appeal in such a Proceeding or any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, by reason of the fact that such Person, or a Person of which such Person is the legal representative, is or was a Member or Affiliate thereof, a Member Designee, Partnership Representative or a representative, officer, director or employee of any of the foregoing, shall be indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment) against all liabilities and expenses (including judgments, penalties (including excise and similar taxes and punitive damages), losses, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees)) actually incurred by such Person in connection with such Proceeding, appeal, inquiry or investigation (each a “Loss”), unless such Loss shall have been primarily the result of bad faith, gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct by the Person seeking indemnification hereunder (or, in the case of the Administrative Agent, a breach of its duties under the Administration Agreement), in which case such indemnification shall not cover such Loss to the extent resulting from such bad faith, gross negligence, fraud, or intentional misconduct (or, in the case of the Administrative Agent, a breach of its duties under the Administration Agreement). A Person who has ceased to serve in the capacity which initially entitled such Person to indemnity hereunder shall continue to be entitled to indemnity hereunder. The rights granted pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall be contract rights to the indemnified Persons hereunder, and no amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.12 shall have the effect of limiting or denying any such rights with respect to actions taken or Proceedings, appeals, inquiries or investigations arising prior to any such amendment, modification or repeal. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no Person entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.12 shall be liable to the Company or any Member for any act or omission performed or omitted by or on behalf of the Company; provided that such act or omission has not been fully adjudicated to constitute bad faith, gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct (or, in the case of the Administrative Agent, a breach of its duties under the Administration Agreement). In addition, any Person entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.12 may consult with legal counsel selected with reasonable care and shall incur no liability to the Company or any Member to the extent that such Person acted or refrained from acting in good faith in reliance upon the opinion or advice of such counsel.

 

19
 

 

 

(b)                The right to indemnification conferred in Section 6.12(a) shall include the right to be paid or reimbursed by the Company for the reasonable expenses incurred by a Person entitled to be indemnified under Section 6.12(a) who was, is or is threatened to be made, a named defendant or respondent in a Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding and without any determination as to the Person’s ultimate entitlement to indemnification; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by any such Person in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of a written undertaking by such Person to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall be finally adjudicated that such indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.12 or otherwise; provided, further, that such advancement of expenses by the Company shall not be made to such Person in the event that the Proceeding involves a Member, the Administrative Agent or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and another Member, the Administrative Agent, or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand.

 

(c)                The Company, with Prior Committee Approval, may indemnify and advance expenses to an employee or agent of the Company to the same extent and subject to the same conditions under which it may indemnify and advance expenses to a Member under Sections 6.12(a) and (b).

 

(d)                The right to indemnification and the advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this Section 6.12 shall not be exclusive of any other right that a Member or other Person indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.12 may have or hereafter acquire under any law (common or statutory) or provision of this Agreement.

 

(e)                The indemnification rights provided by this Section 6.12 shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns of each Person indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.12.

 

(f)                 The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide JV Partner with written notice of any indemnification or advancements of fees and expenses to BCSF or any of its Affiliates or representatives pursuant to Section 6.12(a) or 6.12(b), as applicable.

 

Section 6.13            Partnership Representative.

 

(a)                BCSF will serve as the “partnership representative” of the Company as provided in Section 6223(a) of the Code (or any successor or similar provision of U.S. federal, state or local law) and a “designated individual” that is subject to the control of BCSF will be appointed by the Company through whom the partnership representative will act (individually and collectively referred to as the “Partnership Representative”). In such capacity, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, the Partnership Representative shall have sole discretion to make or refrain from making any election or otherwise act on behalf of the Company (at the Company’s expense) in connection with all examinations of the Company’s affairs by tax authorities, including resulting administrative and judicial proceedings. The Partnership Representative shall have the right to retain professional assistance in respect of any audit of the Company and all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses and fees incurred by the Partnership Representative on behalf of the Company as Partnership Representative shall be reimbursed by the Company. Each Member agrees to cooperate with the Partnership Representative and provide such information as may be reasonably requested by the Partnership Representative in relation to carrying out its responsibilities under Section 6223 of the Code (and the regulations promulgated thereunder). The Company agrees to indemnify the Partnership Representative and its agents and save and hold them harmless, from and in respect to all Losses incurred by the Partnership Representative in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, or demand against the Partnership Representative or the Company that arise out of or in any way relate to the Partnership Representative’s status as “partnership representative” of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership Representative shall not take any action requiring Prior Committee Approval prior to such Prior Committee Approval being obtained.

 

20
 

 

(b)                If the Company is subject to any tax liability imposed under Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code, as well as any related interest, penalties, or other charges or expenses (collectively, a “Tax Liability”), the Members (acting through the Committee) (or the Partnership Representative, in consultation with the Members (acting through the Committee)) shall allocate among the Members any Tax Liability in a manner it determines to be fair and equitable and the Capital Accounts hereunder by deducting amounts from Capital Accounts or reducing amounts otherwise distributable to Members, taking into account any modifications attributable to a Member pursuant to Section 6225(c) of the Code and any similar state and local authority. To the extent that a portion of a Tax Liability for a prior tax year relates to a former Member, the Members (acting through the Committee) (or the Partnership Representative, in consultation with the Members (acting through the Committee)) may require a former Member to indemnify the Company for its allocable portion of such tax. Each Member acknowledges that, notwithstanding the Transfer or withdrawal of all or any portion of its interest in the Company, pursuant to this Section 6.13, it may remain liable for Tax Liabilities with respect to its allocable share of income and gain of the Company for the Company’s tax years (or portions thereof) prior to such Transfer or withdrawal, as applicable, under Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code or any similar state or local provisions. Any Tax Liability that is payable by the Company shall, to the extent attributable to a Member’s (or a former Member’s) interest in the Company, be treated as distributed or otherwise paid to such Member in the same manner as a withholding tax. The Members acknowledge and agree that the Members (acting through the Committee) or the Partnership Representative shall be permitted to take any actions to avoid Tax Liability being imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Portfolio Companies under Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Member hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the other Members from and against any Tax Liability incurred by the Company or such other Members with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Member, except in the event such liability arises due to the Company’s bad faith, gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct (or, in the case of the Administrative Agent, a breach of its duties under the Administration Agreement). Each Member agrees that, notwithstanding the Transfer of all or any portion of its interest in the Company, if requested by the Committee, it shall provide an IRS Form W-9, the appropriate IRS Form W-8 or any other certificate or documentation, which, the Committee reasonably determines, is necessary.

 

(c)                Company Audits.

 

(i)                 The Partnership Representative shall (or with respect to any Applicable Entity other than the Company, BCSF shall cause the applicable general partner or other Affiliate thereof serving in a like capacity to) use commercially reasonable efforts to secure any reduction in any imputed underpayment within the meaning of Section 6225 of the Code, and for which any Applicable Entity has not made the election provided in Section 6226 of the Code, that is available by reason of a Member’s status (including by means of any procedures provided pursuant to Section 6225(c)(3) of the Code) and the Company shall apportion the benefit of any such reduction to such Member (or, with respect to any Applicable Entity other than the Company, the entity through which such Member directly or indirectly invests in such entity) pursuant to this Agreement (or, with respect to any Applicable Entity other than the Company, the applicable organizational documents of such Applicable Entity), provided that in no event shall the Partnership Representative be required to take any action under this paragraph to the extent the Partnership Representative determines such action could have an adverse impact on the Company, or any other Member (or, with respect to any Applicable Entity other than the Company, such Applicable Entity or its owners).

 

21
 

 

(ii)               If the Company (or, with respect to any Applicable Entity other than the Company, the applicable general partner or other Affiliate thereof serving in a like capacity) determines, consistent with applicable legal or regulatory requirements or its fiduciary duties to allocate the economic burden (including the responsibility for funding or payment) of any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax or interest imposed on any Applicable Entity under Sections 6225 and 6232 of the Code, in whole or in part, to a Member (directly or indirectly), then the Company, as promptly as reasonably possible and, to the extent reasonably practicable, prior to payment of any tax, penalty, addition to tax, or interest, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Member with a written notice that sets forth the amount of the liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax, and interest imposed on such Member, and if such notice cannot be provided prior to payment, to provide such notice as promptly as reasonably possible after such payment is made. Each of the Company and the Partnership Representative shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such additional documentation and reasonable assistance to such Member as reasonably requested by such Member, at the Member’s expense, to permit such Member to oppose the imposition of such taxes, penalties, additions to tax, or interest by the IRS or to otherwise use any other reasonably available means to reduce such amount.

 

(iii)             The Partnership Representative shall inform each Member as to the initiation of an audit of the Company’s tax affairs by the IRS. If an audit of any of the Company’s tax returns shall occur, neither the Company nor the Partnership Representative shall settle or otherwise compromise assertions of the auditing agent which may be materially adverse to the Members or their respective investors without first advising such Members in writing of the proposed action.

 

(iv)              This Section 6.13(c) shall apply, to the extent applicable, to any substantively similar and material U.S. state and local tax audit regimes.

 

(d)                Each Member’s obligation to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.13 shall survive such Member’s ceasing to be a Member of the Company, the termination, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, or the termination of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 7
TRANSFERS OF COMPANY INTERESTS; WITHDRAWALS

 

Section 7.1               Transfers by Members.

 

(a)                Subject to the requirements of this Article 7, any portion of a Member’s interest in the Company may be Transferred with Prior Committee Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Member may make a transfer in accordance with Section 8.3(e), in each case if such Transfer is otherwise in accordance with the requirements of this Article 7 (each, a “Permitted Transfer”); provided, that in each case, the transferor remains liable for its Capital Commitment.

 

(b)                No Transfer by a Member shall be binding upon the Company until the Company receives an executed copy of such documentation as reasonably requested by the other Members to demonstrate that such Transfer is in accordance with this Article 7.

 

22
 

 

(c)                Any Person which acquires an interest in the Company by Transfer in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be admitted as a substitute Member, provided that the requirements of this Agreement are satisfied. The admission of a transferee as a substitute Member shall be conditioned upon the transferee’s written assumption, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the other Members, of all obligations of the transferor in respect of the Transferred interest and execution of an instrument reasonably satisfactory to the other Members whereby such transferee becomes a party to this Agreement. Any transferee of the interest of a Member, irrespective of whether such transferee has accepted and adopted in writing the terms and provisions of this Agreement, shall be deemed by the acceptance of such Transfer to have agreed to be subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the same manner as its transferor.

 

(d)                The Capital Contribution of a Member that is an assignee of all or a portion of an membership interest in the Company shall include the Capital Contribution of the assignor (or a pro rata portion thereof in the case of an assignment of less than the Entire Interest of the assignor).

 

(e)                In the event any Member shall be adjudicated as bankrupt, or in the event of the winding up or liquidation of a Member, the legal representative of such Member shall, upon written notice to the other Members of the happening, become a transferee of such Member’s interest, subject to all of the terms of this Agreement as then in effect.

 

(f)                 As additional conditions to the validity of any Transfer of a Member’s interest, such assignment shall not:

 

(i)                 violate the registration provisions of the Securities Act or the securities laws of any applicable jurisdiction;

 

(ii)               cause the Company to cease to be entitled to the exemption from the definition of an “investment company” pursuant to either Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;

 

(iii)             result in the Company having more than ninety (90) members;

 

(iv)              cause the Company to be treated as a “publicly traded partnership” subject to tax as a corporation within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code;

 

(v)                unless each of the other Members waives in writing the application of this clause (v) with respect to such assignment (which any of the other Members may refuse to do in its absolute discretion), be to a Person which is an employment benefit plan within the meaning of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time; or

 

(vi)              cause the Company or any other Member to be in violation of, or effect an assignment to a Person that is in violation of, applicable law.

 

The non-Transferring Member may require reasonable evidence as to the foregoing, including an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the non-Transferring Member (which may be in-house counsel of such Transferring Member). Any purported Transfer as to which the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (vi) of this Section 7.1(f) are not satisfied shall be void ab initio. A Transferring Member shall be responsible for all Expenses incurred by the Company, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, in connection with any assignment or proposed assignment.

 

23
 

 

(g)                BCSF hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to Amberstone, and Amberstone hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to BCSF, a right of first offer to purchase or designate a third party to purchase all, but not less than all, of any interest in the Company that such Member may propose to Transfer to another Person in accordance with the following:

 

(i)                 The Member proposing to make a Transfer that would be subject to this Section 7.1(g) must deliver written notice of its intention to Transfer such interest (the “Notice of Intent”) to the other Members not later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the proposed closing date of such Transfer. Such Notice of Intent shall contain the proposed purchase price for the interest subject of such proposed Transfer and the other material terms and conditions of such proposed Transfer and shall identify the proposed transferee of such interest, if known.

 

(ii)               The Member receiving the Notice of Intent shall have the right, for a period of fifteen (15) Business Days from the date of receipt of the Notice of Intent (the “Acceptance Period”), to accept the interest or to designate a third-party purchaser to accept such interest at the valuation most recently approved in accordance with Section 9.5 and on the other terms stated in the Notice of Intent. Such acceptance shall be made by delivering a written notice to the selling Member and the Company within the Acceptance Period stating that it elects to exercise its right of first offer and, if applicable, providing the identity of any Person that the non-transferring Member designates as the purchaser.

 

(iii)             Following expiration of the Acceptance Period, the selling Member shall be free to sell its interest in the Company to a third party in a Transfer that otherwise meets the requirements of this Section 7.1 on terms and conditions it deems acceptable (but at a price not less than the price and on terms not more favorable to the purchaser thereof than the price and terms stated in the Notice of Intent); provided that such sale takes place within one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days after the expiration of the Acceptance Period (the “Sale Period”). To the extent the selling Member Transfers its interest in the Company during the Sale Period, the selling Member shall promptly notify the Company, and the Company shall promptly notify the other Members, as to the terms of such Transfer and the name of the owner(s) to whom the interest was Transferred. If no such sale occurs during the Sale Period, any attempted Transfer of such interest shall again be subject to the right of first offer set forth in this Section 7.1(g) and such procedures shall be repeated de novo.

 

(iv)              To the extent any amounts are owed by a Defaulting Member to a Loan Holder with respect to a Default Loan, any purchase price that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Member under this Section 7.1(g) shall instead first be paid to the Loan Holder pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3(a)(iv) hereof, until each such Default Loan (and any interest thereon) has been repaid in full with the remainder thereof, if any, payable to the Defaulting Member.

 

(h)                Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) this Section 7.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Subordinated Notes as if such Subordinated Notes constituted an interest in the Company and (ii) a Transfer by a Member of its interest in the Company and its Subordinated Notes shall be effective only if the Transferring Member simultaneously transfers or assigns the same proportion of its interest in the Company and its Subordinated Notes to the same Person.

 

24
 

 

Section 7.2               Withdrawal or Resignation by Members(a). Except as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement, a Member may not resign or withdraw from the Company without Prior Committee Approval. The remaining Members may, in their sole discretion, cause the Company to distribute to the resigning or withdrawing Member the balance in its Capital Account on the date of such resignation or withdrawal. Upon the distribution to the resigning or withdrawing Member of the balance in such Member’s Capital Account, the resigning or withdrawing Member shall have no further rights with respect to the Company. Any Member resigning or withdrawing in contravention of this Section 7.2 shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and all other Members from and against any Losses suffered or incurred by the Company or any such other Member arising out of or resulting from such resignation or withdrawal.

Section 8.1               Term and Investment Period. Except as provided in Section 8.2, the Company’s investment period shall continue for a four-year period. This period may be extended thereafter in one-year increments upon Prior Committee Approval. The Company shall continue without dissolution until the twelfth (12th) anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Term”).

(e)                (i) the full resignation and withdrawal of BCSF or Amberstone without Prior Committee Approval, or (ii) a bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of BCSF or Amberstone, as applicable, or (iii) the making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors by BCSF or Amberstone, as applicable, or (iv) a default under Section 3.3 by BCSF or Amberstone, as applicable, which remains uncured or unwaived after the expiration of the cure period set forth in Section 3.3, in each case of clauses (ii) through (iv) above unless resolved otherwise by the other Member; or

 

(f)                 the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution pursuant to the Act, in which event the provisions of Section 8.3, as modified by said decree, shall govern the winding up of the Company’s affairs.

 

25
 

 

Section 8.3               Wind-down.

 

(a)                Upon the dissolution of the Company, the Company shall be liquidated in accordance with this Article 8 and the Act. The liquidation shall be conducted and supervised by the Members (acting through the Committee) in the same manner provided by Article 6 with respect to the operation of the Company during its term; provided, that in the case of a dissolution and winding up of the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(d) or Section 8.2(e), the Member that elects such dissolution and winding up (or in the case of a full withdrawal of a Member under Section 8.2(e), the non-withdrawing Member) may elect further, by written notice to the other Members, to exercise as liquidating agent all of the rights, powers and authority with respect to the assets and liabilities of the Company in connection with the liquidation of the Company, to the same extent as the Members (acting through the Committee) would have during the term of the Company. In the case of a dissolution and winding up of the Company, subject to and without limiting any provision of this Agreement, the Members shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete, and to cause the Company and the Administrative Agent to complete, the liquidation as set forth in this Section 8.3 within two (2) years from the date on which an event set forth in Section 8.3 becomes effective (which, if such liquidation has not been completed by such time, may be extended by Prior Committee Approval for up to an additional twelve (12) months).

 

(b)                From and after the earlier of the date on which an event set forth in Section 8.2 becomes effective or the Company’s investment period as set forth in Section 8.1 ends, the Company shall cease to make Investments after that date, except for (i) Investments which the Company was committed to make in whole or in part (as evidenced by a commitment letter, term sheet or letter of intent, or definitive legal documents under which less than all advances have been made) on or before such effective date and (ii) at the election of the Members (acting through the Committee). Capital calls against the Capital Commitment of the Members shall cease from and after such effective date; provided that capital calls against the Capital Commitment of the Members may continue to fund the allocable share of Investments in which the Company continues to participate (as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence), Expenses and all other obligations of the Company. Subject to the foregoing, from and after an event in Section 8.2(a) becomes effective, the Members shall continue to bear an allocable share of Expenses and other obligations of the Company until all Investments in which the Company participates are repaid or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of the Company’s activities.

 

(c)                Distributions of Available Cash to the Members during the winding down of the Company shall be made no less frequently than quarterly. Unless waived by the Members (with Prior Committee Approval), the Company also shall withhold five percent (5%) of distributions in any calendar year, which withheld amount shall be distributed within sixty (60) days after the completion of the annual audit covering such fiscal period ended with or within such calendar year. A Member shall remain a member of the Company until all Investments are repaid or otherwise disposed of, the Member’s allocable share of all Expenses and all other obligations (including contingent obligations) of the Company are paid, and all distributions are made hereunder, at which time the Member shall have no further rights under this Agreement.

 

(d)                Upon dissolution of the Company, final allocations of all items of Profit or Loss shall be made in accordance with Section 4.2. Upon dissolution of the Company, the assets of the Company shall be applied in the following order of priority:

 

(i)                 To creditors (other than Members) in satisfaction of liabilities of the Company (whether by payment or by the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof), including to establish any reasonable reserves which the Members (acting through the Committee), in their reasonable judgment, deem necessary or advisable for any contingent, conditional or unmatured liability of the Company;

 

(ii)               To creditors who are Members in satisfaction of liabilities of the Company (whether by payment or by the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof), including to establish any reasonable reserves which the Members (acting through the Committee), in their reasonable judgment, deem necessary or advisable for any contingent, conditional or unmatured liability of the Company;

 

26
 

 

(iii)             To establish any reserves which the Members (acting through the Committee), in their reasonable judgment, deem necessary or advisable for any contingent, conditional or unmatured liability of the Company to Members;

 

(iv)              The balance, if any, to the Members in accordance with Section 5.1(b) and Section 5.1(c); provided, however, in connection with the Company’s final liquidating distribution, the profit allocation paid to BCSF with respect to the Class A Preferred Interests will be subject to a make-whole provision to be paid to Amberstone if Amberstone did not earn at least the Base Return. The final liquidating distribution shall be adjusted to the extent possible to provide Amberstone with its Base Return; provided, however, that to the extent the amount of the liquidating distribution is not sufficient to provide Amberstone with its Base Return, BCSF will make a Capital Contribution to the Company in an amount to cure such deficiency, provided that the contribution, or the adjustment, will not exceed (a) the total distributions to BCSF with respect to the Class A Preferred Interests that has not been reversed minus (b) taxes on such amount. The Administrative Agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to manage reserves, if needed, during the dissolution period to seek to ensure that, to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, the Company has sufficient cash to make a final liquidating distribution that will provide JV Partner with its Base Return, subject to the foregoing limitation.

 

(e)                Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an event described in Section 8.2(e), the Member(s) not subject to such event (BCSF or Amberstone, as the case may be, the “Electing Member”) may elect alternatively by written notice to the other Member, for a period of twenty (20) Business Days following the occurrence of such event, to purchase the other Member’s Entire Interest and all of such other Member’s Subordinated Notes or designate a third party to effect such purchase or designate a third party to effect such purchase (such election, the “Offer to Purchase”). The purchase price for such Entire Interest and such Subordinated Notes shall be payable in cash within sixty (60) Business Days after the Offer to Purchase is delivered to the other Member, and shall be no less than fair value of the other Member’s Entire Interest and all of such Other Member’s Subordinated Notes determined in accordance with Section 9.5; provided, however, that to the extent any amounts are owed by a Defaulting Member to a Loan Holder with respect to a Default Loan, any purchase price that would otherwise be payable to the Defaulting Member under this Section 8.3(e) shall instead first be paid to the Loan Holder pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3(a)(iv) hereof, until each such Default Loan (and any interest thereon) has been repaid in full with the remainder thereof, if any, payable to the Defaulting Member. Each Member hereby agrees to sell its Entire Interest and all of such Member’s Subordinated Notes to the Electing Member or the third party designated by the Electing Member at such price if the Offer to Purchase is timely exercised by the Electing Member. If the Electing Member does not exercise the Offer to Purchase within the twenty (20)-Business Day period set forth in this Section 8.3(e) or if the Electing Member or its third-party designee does not purchase the other Member’s Entire Interest and all of such other Member’s Subordinated Notes within sixty (60) Business Days after the Offer to Purchase is delivered to such other Member, then the Offer to Purchase (and such other Member’s acceptance of such offer) shall terminate and the other Member shall withdraw its or their Entire Interest pursuant to Section 7.2 and the Company shall terminate as provided by this Article 8. After any purchase pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, the other Member shall no longer be a member of the Company, and the Electing Member, or third-party designee of the Electing Member that has consummated the purchase, may dissolve or continue the Company as it may determine.

(f)                 In the event that an audit or reconciliation relating to the fiscal year in which a Member receives a distribution under this Section 8.3 reveals that such Member received a distribution in excess of that to which such Member was entitled, each other Member may, in its discretion, seek repayment of such distribution to the extent that such distribution exceeded what was due to such Member.

 

(g)                Each Member shall be furnished with a statement prepared by the Company’s accountant, which shall set forth the assets and liabilities of the Company as of the date of complete liquidation, and each Member’s share thereof. Upon compliance with the distribution plan set forth in this Section 8.3, the Members shall cease to be such, and either Member may execute, acknowledge and cause to be filed a certificate of cancellation of the Company.
