“Amendment No. 2 Effective Date” means March 7, 2022.
(b)Section 6.01(i) of the Credit Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following is inserted in lieu thereof (solely for the sake of convenience in reviewing this Amendment, the language changed in such section is set forth in bold italics):

(b)The representations and warranties of the Borrower set forth in the Credit Agreement and in the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any portion of the representations and warranties already subject to a materiality qualifier, true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Amendment Effective Date, or, as to any such representation or warranty that refers to a specific date, as of such specific date.
(c)As of the Amendment Effective Date, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to entitle any Obligor to a consent to, or a waiver, amendment, modification or other change of, any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document in similar or different circumstances. On and after the Amendment Effective Date, each reference in the Credit Agreement to “this Agreement”, “herein”, “hereunder”, “hereto”, “hereof” and

Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Amendment by telecopy or other electronic means (including .pdf email transmittal) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment.
