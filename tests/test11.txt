Shortened Interest Period:  If paragraph (a) above applies but it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Primary Term Rate, the Interest Period of the Loan shall (if it is longer than the applicable Fallback Interest Period) be shortened to the applicable Fallback Interest Period and the applicable Term Reference Rate shall be determined pursuant to the relevant definition.


37



(c)

Shortened Interest Period and Historic Primary Term Rate:  If paragraph (b) above applies but no Primary Term Rate is available for the Interest Period of that Loan and it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Primary Term Rate, the applicable Term Reference Rate shall be the Historic Primary Term Rate for that Loan.

(e)

Alternative Term Rate: If paragraph (d) above applies but it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Historic Primary Term Rate, the Interest Period of that Loan shall, if it has been shortened pursuant to paragraph (b) above, revert to its previous length and the applicable Term Reference Rate shall be the aggregate of:

(i)

the Alternative Term Rate as of the Quotation Time for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of that Loan; and

(ii)

any applicable Alternative Term Rate Adjustment.

(f)

Interpolated Alternative Term Rate:  If paragraph (e) above applies but no Alternative Term Rate is available for the Interest Period of that Loan, the applicable Term Reference Rate shall be the aggregate of:

any applicable Alternative Term Rate Adjustment.

(g)

Compounded Reference Rate or cost of funds: If paragraph (f) above applies but it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Alternative Term Rate then:

If this Clause 11.4 applies to a Loan for an Interest Period neither Clause 9.1 (Calculation of interest â€“ Term Rate Loans) nor Clause 9.2 (Calculation of interest â€“ Compounded Rate Loans) shall apply to that Loan for that Interest Period and the rate of interest on the relevant Loan for the relevant Interest Period will be the percentage rate per annum which is the sum of:

(i)

the applicable Margin; and

(ii)

the weighted average of the rates notified to the Facility Agent by each Lender as soon as practicable, and in any event by the Reporting Time for that Loan, to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum its cost of funds relating to its participation in that Loan.

(A)

is compensated for by an increased payment under Clause 13.2 (Tax gross-up); or

13.4

If an Obligor makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Finance Party determines that:

(a)

a Tax Credit is attributable to:

(i)

an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part;

(ii)

that Tax Payment; or

(iii)

a Tax Deduction in consequence of which that Tax Payment was required; and

(b)

that Finance Party has obtained and utilised that Tax Credit, the Finance Party must pay an amount to the Obligor which that Finance Party determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Obligor.

13.5

Lender status confirmation

(a)

Each Lender which becomes a Party after the Signing Date must indicate, in the Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement, Increase Confirmation or Accordion Increase Confirmation which it executes on becoming a Party, and for the benefit of the Facility Agent and without liability to any Obligor, which of the following categories it falls in:

a Qualifying Lender (other than a Treaty Lender); or

a Treaty Lender.

13.7

Value added taxes

(a)

All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document, and such Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying the consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (and such Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to that Party).

(b)

If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the Supplier) to any other Finance Party (the Recipient) under a Finance Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the Relevant Party) is required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):

(i)

(where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT), the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of such VAT.  The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and

(ii)

(where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT), the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.

(c)

Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance Party for any cost or expense, that Party must reimburse and indemnify (as the case may be) the Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including that part which represents VAT, except to the extent that the Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority.

(d)

Any reference in this Clause 13.7 to any Party will, at any time when that Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of that group at that time (the term representative member to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).

(e)

In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document, if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly provide such Finance Party with details of that Party's VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party's VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.

(d)

If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information relating to its status under FATCA requested in accordance with paragraph (a) above (including where paragraph (c) above applies), then that Party may be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents (and payments made under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.

13.9

FATCA Deduction

(a)

Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party is required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.

(b)

Each Party must, promptly on becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA Deduction), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, must notify the Company and the Facility Agent, and the Facility Agent must promptly notify the other Finance Parties.

54



liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under this Clause 18 will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.

18.4

(i)

any amendment to a Finance Document is within the scope of this guarantee; and

(ii)

this guarantee extends to any amount payable by the Company under or in connection with a Finance Document as amended.

(c)

Each Guarantor agrees that the confirmations in paragraph (b) above apply regardless of:

(i)

why or how a Finance Document is amended (including the extent of the amendment and any change in the parties);

(iv)

whether the Guarantor was aware of or consented to the amendment.

18.6

Immediate recourse

(a)

Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to:

(i)

proceed, whether by virtue of the droit de discussion or otherwise, against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person; and

divide, apportion or reduce, whether by virtue of the droit de division or otherwise, any liability under this Clause 18 with any person,

before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 18.

refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce them in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor will be entitled to the benefit of such moneys, security or rights; and

hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this Clause 18.

to be indemnified by an Obligor;

to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;

56

to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under this Clause;

(v)

to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or

(vi)

to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party.

18.9

Release of Guarantors' right of contribution

If any Guarantor (a Retiring Guarantor) ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring Guarantor, then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:

(a)

that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and

(b)

each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under any Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.

Additional security

This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party.

18.11

Limitations

CHANGES TO THE LENDERS

24.1

Assignments and transfers by the Lenders

assign any of its rights; or

(b)

transfer by novation any of its rights and obligations, under the Finance Documents to another bank or financial institution (the New Lender).

24.2

Conditions of assignment or transfer

(a)

The prior written consent of the Company is required for an assignment or transfer unless the assignment or transfer is:

(i)

to another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender (subject to paragraph (c)(ii) below); or


76



(ii)

effected at a time when an Event of Default is continuing.

(b)

The consent of the Company to an assignment or transfer (if required) must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  The Company will be deemed to have given its consent ten Business Days after the Company is given notice of the request unless consent is expressly refused by the Company within that time.

(c)

For the avoidance of the doubt:

(i)

the Company's withholding of consent on the basis of the credit rating of an assignee or transferee shall be deemed to be reasonable; and

(ii)

the Company may restrict transfers to any Affiliate of a Lender who does not, in the ordinary course of its business, lend facilities of this type and does not have a credit profile deemed by the Company to be reasonable.

(d)

An assignment will only be effective on:

(i)

receipt by the Facility Agent (whether in the Assignment Agreement or otherwise) of written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent) that the New Lender will, in relation to the assigned rights, assume obligations to the other Parties equivalent to those it would have been under if it had been an Original Lender; and

(ii)

performance by the Facility Agent of any "know your customer" checks or other similar checks required under any applicable law or regulation in relation to such assignment to a New Lender, the completion of which the Facility Agent must notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender promptly.

(e)

If the consent of the Company is required for any assignment or transfer, the Facility Agent is not obliged to enter into a Transfer Certificate or Assignment Agreement if the Company withholds its consent (irrespective of whether it is being reasonable in withholding that consent).

(f)

A transfer will only be effective if the procedure set out in Clause 24.5 (Procedure for transfer) is complied with.

(g)

If:

(i)

a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office; and

(ii)

as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or change occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a Tax Payment or a payment relating to Increased Costs, then the relevant Obligor need only make that Tax Payment or payment relating to Increased Costs to the same extent that it would have been obliged to pay if the assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.  This paragraph (g) will not apply:

(A)

in respect of an assignment or transfer made as a result of Clause 16 (Mitigation by the Lenders); or

(B)

in relation to Clause 13 (Tax gross-up and indemnities) in respect of an assignment or transfer to a Treaty Lender that has included a confirmation of its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with paragraph (g)(ii)(B) of Clause 13.2 (Tax gross-up) if the Obligor making the payment has not made a Borrower DTTP Filing (as defined in paragraph (a) of Clause 13.1 (Definitions)) in respect of that Treaty Lender.


77



(h)

Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or Assignment Agreement, confirms that:

(i)

the Facility Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this Agreement on or before the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes effective in accordance with this Agreement; and

it is bound by that decision to the same extent as the Existing Lender would have been had it remained a Lender.

24.4

Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders

(a)

Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New Lender for:

(i)

the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the Finance Documents or any other documents;

(ii)

the financial condition of any Obligor;

(iii)

the performance and observance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Finance Documents or any other documents; or

(iv)

the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with any Finance Document or any other document, and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded.

(b)

Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender and the other Finance Parties that it:

(i)

has made (and must continue to make) its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its related entities (including the nature and extent of any recourse against any Party or its assets) in connection with its participation in this Agreement and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing Lender in connection with any Finance Document; and

(ii)

will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and its related entities while any amount is or may be outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.

(c)

Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:

(i)

accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights and obligations assigned or transferred under this Clause 24; or

(ii)

support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason of the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Finance Documents or otherwise.


78



24.5

Procedure for transfer

(a)

Subject to the conditions set out in Clause 24.2 (Conditions of assignment or transfer), a transfer is effected in accordance with paragraph (c) below when the Facility Agent executes an otherwise duly completed Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender.

(b)

The Facility Agent is only obliged to execute a Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied with the results of any "know your customer" checks or other similar checks required under any applicable law or regulation in relation to the transfer to such New Lender.

(c)

Subject to Clause 24.9 (Pro rata interest settlement), on the Transfer Date:

(i)

to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks to transfer by novation its rights and obligations under the Finance Documents, each of the Obligors and the Existing Lender will be released from further obligations towards one another under the Finance Documents and their respective rights against one another under the Finance Documents will be cancelled (being the Discharged Rights and Obligations);

(ii)

each of the Obligors and the New Lender will assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as that Obligor and the New Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of that Obligor and the Existing Lender;

(iii)

each Administrative Party, the New Lender and other Lenders will acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between themselves as they would have acquired and assumed had the New Lender been an Original Lender with the rights and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent each Administrative Party and the Existing Lender will each be released from further obligations to each other under the Finance Documents; and

(iv)

the New Lender will become a Party as a Lender.

(d)

Each Party (other than the Existing Lender and the New Lender) irrevocably authorises the Facility Agent to enter into and deliver any duly completed Transfer Certificate on its behalf.

24.6

The Facility Agent is only obliged to execute an Assignment Agreement delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied with the results of any "know your customer" checks or other similar checks required under any applicable law or regulation in relation to the assignment to such New Lender.

(c)

Subject to Clause 24.9 (Pro rata interest settlement), on the Transfer Date:


79

(iii)

the New Lender will become a Party as a Lender and will be bound by obligations equivalent to the Relevant Obligations;

(iv)

if the assignment relates only to part of the Existing Lender's participation in the outstanding Loans, that part will be separated from the Existing Lender's participation in the outstanding Loans, made an independent debt and assigned to the New Lender as a whole debt; and

(v)

the Facility Agent's execution of the Assignment Agreement as agent for the Company will constitute notice to the Company of the assignment.

(d)

Each Party (other than the Existing Lender and the New Lender) irrevocably authorises the Facility Agent to enter into and deliver any duly completed Assignment Agreement on its behalf.

(e)

Lenders may utilise procedures other than those set out in this Clause 24.6 to assign their rights under the Finance Documents (but not, without the consent of the relevant Obligor or unless in accordance with Clause 24.5 (Procedure for transfer), to obtain a release by that Obligor from the obligations owed to that Obligor by the Lenders nor the assumption of equivalent obligations by a New Lender) provided that they comply with the conditions set out in Clause 24.2 (Conditions of assignment or transfer).

24.7

Copy of Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation to the Company

The Facility Agent must, as soon as reasonably practicable after it has executed a Transfer Certificate, an Assignment Agreement or an Increase Confirmation, send to the Company a copy of that Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation.

24.8

Security over Lenders' rights

In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this Clause 24, each Lender may without consulting with or obtaining consent from any Obligor, at any time charge, assign or otherwise create a Security Interest in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or any of its rights under any Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender to a federal reserve or central bank, except that no such charge, assignment or Security Interest will:

(i)

release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Finance Documents or substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security Interest for the Lender as a party to any of the Finance Documents; or

(ii)

require any payments to be made by an Obligor other than or in excess of, or grant to any person any more extensive rights than, those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Finance Documents.

24.9

Pro rata interest settlement

(a)

If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a pro rata basis to Existing Lenders and New Lenders, then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to Clause 24.5 (Procedure for transfer) or any assignment pursuant to Clause 24.6 (Procedure for assignment) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after the date of that notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period):


80



(i)

any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time will continue to accrue in favour of the Existing Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date (Accrued Amounts) and will become due and payable to the Existing Lender (without further interest accruing on them) on the last day of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the next of the dates which falls at six Monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period); and

(ii)

the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts, so that:

(A)

when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable to the Existing Lender; and

(B)

the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this Clause 24.9, have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.

(b)

In this Clause 24.9, references to Interest Periods will be construed to include a reference to any other period for accrual of fees.

24.10

Affiliates of Lenders

Each Lender may fulfil its obligations in respect of any Loan through an Affiliate if:

(i)

the relevant Affiliate is specified in this Agreement as a Lender or becomes a Lender by means of a Transfer Certificate or Assignment Agreement in accordance with this Agreement; and

In this event, the Lender and its Affiliate will participate in such Loan or Loans in the manner provided for in the notice referred to in paragraph (ii) above.

(b)

If paragraph (a) above applies, the Lender and its Affiliate will be treated as having a single Commitment and a single vote, but, for all other purposes, will be treated as separate Lenders.

(c)

Except to the extent that the Majority Lenders notify the Facility Agent to the contrary before the Facility Agent gives the notification described in paragraph (b) above, each Lender authorises (but does not require) the Facility Agent to give that notification.  The Facility Agent will not be liable for any cost, loss or liability whatsoever any person incurs as a result of the Facility Agent giving any such notification.

(d)

If the accession of an Additional Guarantor requires any Finance Party or prospective new Lender to carry out "know your customer" checks or other similar checks under any applicable law or regulation in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company must, promptly on request by any Finance Party, supply, or procure the supply of, any documentation or other evidence reasonably requested by that Finance Party (whether for itself, or on behalf of any other Finance Party or any prospective new Lender) to enable a Finance Party or prospective new Lender to carry out and be satisfied with the results of those checks.

25.3

(c)

Except in the case of decisions stipulated to be a matter for any other Finance Party or group of Finance Parties under the relevant Finance Document and unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document, any instructions given to the Facility Agent by the Majority Lenders will override any conflicting instructions given by any other Party or Parties and will be binding on all Finance Parties.

If giving effect to instructions given by the Majority Lenders would (in the Facility Agent's opinion) have an effect equivalent to an amendment or waiver referred to in Clause 35 (Amendments and waivers), the Facility Agent will not act in accordance with those instructions unless it obtains consent to do so from each Party whose consent would have been required in respect of that amendment or waiver.

(f)

The Facility Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with the instructions of any Finance Party or group of Finance Parties until it has received any indemnification and/or security that it may in its discretion require (which may be greater in extent than that contained in the Finance Documents and which may include payment in advance) for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions.

(b)

The Facility Agent may assume (unless it has received notice to the contrary in its capacity as Facility Agent) that:


85

an Administrative Party may do anything which, in its opinion, is necessary or desirable to comply with any law or regulation.

(i)

Notwithstanding any other provision of any Finance Document to the contrary, no Administrative Party is obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right, power, authority or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of those funds or adequate indemnity against, or security for, that risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

26.8

Responsibility for documentation

the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any statement or information (whether oral or written) made, given or supplied by any person in or in connection with any Finance Document or the Information Memorandum or the transactions contemplated by the Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document;

(A)

any act, event or circumstance not reasonably within its control; or

(e)(i)Nothing in this Agreement obliges any Administrative Party to:

(A)

perform any "know your customer" checks or other similar checks in relation to the identity of any person; or

(B)

check on the extent to which any transaction contemplated by this Agreement might be unlawful for any Finance Party, on behalf of any Finance Party.

Each Finance Party confirms to each Administrative Party that it is solely responsible for any "know your customer" checks or other similar checks it is required to carry out and that it may not rely on any statement in relation to those checks made by any Administrative Party.

(f)

Without prejudice to any other provision of any Finance Document excluding or limiting the liability of any Administrative Party, any liability of an Administrative Party arising under or in connection with any Finance Document is limited to the amount of actual loss suffered (as determined by reference to the date of that Administrative Party's default or, if later, the date on which the loss arises as a result of the default) but without reference to any special conditions or circumstances known to that Administrative Party at any time which increase the amount of that loss.  In no event will an Administrative Party be liable for any loss of profits, goodwill, reputation, business opportunity or


88



anticipated saving, or for special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages, whether or not that Administrative Party was advised of the possibility of such loss or damages.

26.11

Lenders' indemnity to the Facility Agent

(a)

Without limiting the liability of any Obligor under the Finance Documents, each Lender must (in proportion to its share of the Total Commitments or, if the Total Commitments are then zero, to its share of the Total Commitments immediately before their reduction to zero) indemnify the Facility Agent against any cost, loss or liability (including, without limitation, for negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever) incurred by the Facility Agent (other than by reason of the Facility Agent's gross negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud) (or, in the case of any cost, loss or liability pursuant to Clause 29.11 (Disruption to payment systems), notwithstanding the Facility Agent's negligence, gross negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever, but not including any claim based on the fraud of the Facility Agent) in acting as Facility Agent under the Finance Documents (unless the Facility Agent has been reimbursed by an Obligor pursuant to a Finance Document).

(b)

Subject to paragraph (c) below, the Company must immediately on demand reimburse any Lender for any payment that Lender makes to the Facility Agent under paragraph (a) above.

(c)

Paragraph (b) above does not apply to the extent that the indemnity payment in respect of which the Lender claims reimbursement relates to a liability of the Facility Agent to an Obligor.

26.12

Resignation of the Facility Agent

(a)

The Facility Agent may resign and appoint one of its Affiliates (acting through an office in the UK) as its successor by giving notice to the other Finance Parties and the Company.

(b)

Alternatively, the Facility Agent may resign by giving 30 days' notice to the other Finance Parties and the Company, in which case the Majority Lenders (after consultation with the other Finance Parties and the Company) may appoint a successor Facility Agent.

(c)

If the Majority Lenders have not appointed a successor Facility Agent in accordance with paragraph (b) above within 20 days after notice of resignation was given, the retiring Facility Agent (after consultation with the other Finance Parties and the Company) may appoint a successor Facility Agent.

(d)

If the Facility Agent wishes to resign because (acting reasonably) it has concluded that it is no longer appropriate for it to remain as agent and the Facility Agent is entitled to appoint a successor Facility Agent under paragraph (c) above, the Facility Agent may (subject to the prior consent of the Company) agree with the proposed successor Facility Agent amendments to this Clause and any other term of this Agreement or any other Finance Document dealing with the rights or obligations of the Facility Agent consistent with then current market practice for the appointment and protection of corporate trustees together with any reasonable amendments to the facility agency fee payable under this Agreement which are consistent with the successor Facility Agent's normal fee rates and those amendments will bind the Parties.

(e)

The retiring Facility Agent must, at its own cost:

(i)

make available to the successor Facility Agent any documents and records and provide any assistance the successor Facility Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as the Facility Agent under the Finance Documents; and

(ii)

enter into and deliver to the successor Facility Agent those documents and effect any registrations as may be reasonably required for the transfer or assignment of all of its rights and benefits under the Finance Documents to the successor Facility Agent.


89



(f)

The Facility Agent's resignation will only take effect on the appointment of a successor.

(g)

When its resignation takes effect:

(i)

the retiring Facility Agent will be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents (other than its obligations under paragraph (e) above) but will remain entitled to the benefit of Clause 15.3 (Indemnity to the Facility Agent) and this Clause 26;

(ii)

the Company must immediately pay to the retiring Facility Agent any facility agency fees that have accrued for the account of the retiring Facility Agent and no further agency fees will accrue for the account of the retiring Facility Agent; and

(iii)

any successor and each of the other Parties will have the same rights and obligations among themselves as they would have had if such successor had been an original Party.

(h)

After consultation with the Company, the Majority Lenders may, by giving notice to the Facility Agent, require it to resign under paragraph (b) above.  In this event, the Facility Agent must resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above.

(i)

The Facility Agent shall resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above (and, to the extent applicable, shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint a successor Facility Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) above) if on or after the date which is three months before the earliest FATCA Application Date relating to any payment to the Facility Agent under the Finance Documents, either:

(i)

the Facility Agent fails to respond to a request under Clause 13.8 (FATCA information) and the Company or a Lender reasonably believes that the Facility Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;

(ii)

the information supplied by the Facility Agent pursuant to Clause 13.8 (FATCA information) indicates that the Facility Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date; or

(iii)

the Facility Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the Facility Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date, and, in each case, the Company or a Lender reasonably believes that a Party will be required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if the Facility Agent were a FATCA Exempt Party, and the Company or that Lender, by notice to the Facility Agent, requires it to resign.

26.13

Confidentiality

(a)

In acting as agent for the Finance Parties, the Facility Agent will be regarded as acting through its agency division which will be treated as a separate entity from any other of its divisions or departments.

(b)

If information is received by another division or department of the Facility Agent, it may be treated as confidential to that division or department and the Facility Agent will not be deemed to have notice of it.

(c)

The Facility Agent is not obliged to disclose to any person any confidential information supplied to it by or on behalf of a member of the Group solely for the purpose of evaluating whether any waiver or amendment is required in respect of any term of the Finance Documents.


90



26.14

Relationship with the Lenders

(a)

Subject to Clause 24.9 (Pro rata interest settlement), the Facility Agent may treat the person shown in its records as Lender at the opening of business (in the place of the Facility Agent's principal office as notified to the Finance Parties from time to time) as the Lender acting through its Facility Office:

(i)

entitled to or liable for any payment due under any Finance Document on that day; and

(ii)

entitled to receive and act on any notice, request, document or communication or make any decision or determination under any Finance Document made or delivered on that day, unless it has received not less than five Business Days' notice from that Lender to the contrary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b)

The Facility Agent may at any time, and must if requested to do so by the Majority Lenders, convene a meeting of the Lenders.

(c)(i)Any Lender may by notice to the Facility Agent appoint a person to receive on its behalf all notices, communications, information and documents to be made or despatched to that Lender under the Finance Documents.

(ii)

Any such notice:

(A)

must contain the address, fax number and (where communication by electronic mail or other electronic means is permitted under this Agreement) electronic mail address and/or any other information required to enable the transmission of information by that means (and, in each case, the department or officer, if any, for whose attention communication is to be made); and

(B)

will be treated as a notification of a substitute address, fax number, electronic mail address (or such other information), and department or officer, by that Lender for the purposes of the Finance Documents.

(iii)

The Facility Agent is entitled to treat such person as the person entitled to receive all such notices, communications, information and documents as though that person were that Lender.

26.15

Credit appraisal by the Lenders

Without affecting the responsibility of any Obligor for information supplied by it or on its behalf in connection with any Finance Document, each Lender confirms to the Administrative Parties that it has been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with any Finance Document including without limitation:

(a)

the financial condition, status and nature of each member of the Group;

(b)

the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of any Finance Document and any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document;

(c)

whether that Lender has recourse, and the nature and extent of that recourse, against any Party or any of its respective assets under or in connection with any Finance Document, the transactions contemplated by the Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document; and


91



(d)

the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of the Information Memorandum and any other information provided by the Facility Agent, any other Party or by any other person under or in connection with any Finance Document, the transactions contemplated by any Finance Document or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document.

26.16

Deduction from amounts payable by the Facility Agent

If any Party owes an amount to the Facility Agent under the Finance Documents, the Facility Agent may, after giving notice to that Party, deduct an amount not exceeding that amount from any payment to that Party which the Facility Agent would otherwise be obliged to make under the Finance Documents and apply the amount deducted in or towards satisfaction of the amount owed.  For the purposes of the Finance Documents, that Party will be regarded as having received the amount so deducted.

26.17

Notice period

Unless expressly provided to the contrary, where this Agreement specifies a minimum period of notice to be given to the Facility Agent, the Facility Agent may, at its discretion, accept a shorter notice period.

27.

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY THE FINANCE PARTIES

No provision of any Finance Document will:

(a)

interfere with the right of any Finance Party to arrange its affairs (Tax or otherwise) in whatever manner it thinks fit;

(b)

oblige any Finance Party to investigate or claim any credit, relief, remission or repayment available to it or the extent, order and manner of any claim; or

(c)

oblige any Finance Party to disclose any information relating to its affairs (Tax or otherwise) or any computations in respect of Tax.

28.

SHARING AMONG THE FINANCE PARTIES

28.1

Payments to Finance Parties

If a Finance Party (a Recovering Finance Party) receives or recovers any amount from an Obligor other than in accordance with Clause 29 (Payment mechanics) and applies that amount to a payment due under a Finance Document, then:

(a)

the Recovering Finance Party must, within three Business Days, notify details of the receipt or recovery to the Facility Agent;

(b)

the Facility Agent must determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of the amount the Recovering Finance Party would have received had the receipt or recovery been received or made by the Facility Agent and distributed in accordance with Clause 29 (Payment mechanics), without taking account of any Tax which would be imposed on the Facility Agent in relation to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and

(c)

the Recovering Finance Party must pay to the Facility Agent an amount (the Sharing Payment) equal to that receipt or recovery less any amount which the Facility Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Finance Party as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with Clause 29.6 (Partial payments).


92



28.2

Redistribution of payments

The Facility Agent must treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Finance Party) (the Sharing Finance Parties) in accordance with Clause 29.6 (Partial payments) towards the obligations of that Obligor to the Sharing Finance Parties.

28.3

Recovering Finance Party's rights

(a)

On a distribution by the Facility Agent under Clause 28.2 (Redistribution of payments), the Recovering Finance Party will be subrogated to the rights of the Finance Parties which have shared in that redistribution.

(b)

If and to the extent that the Recovering Finance Party is not able to rely on its rights under paragraph (a) above, the relevant Obligor will owe the Recovering Finance Party a debt equal to the Sharing Payment which is immediately due and payable.

28.4

Reversal of redistribution

If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Finance Party becomes repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Finance Party, then:

(a)

each Sharing Finance Party must, on request of the Facility Agent, pay to the Facility Agent for the account of that Recovering Finance Party an amount equal to the appropriate part of its share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount as is necessary to reimburse that Recovering Finance Party for its proportion of any interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering Finance Party is required to pay) (the Redistributed Amount);

(b)

at the time of the request by the Facility Agent under paragraph (a) above, the Sharing Finance Party will be subrogated to the rights of the Recovering Finance Party in respect of the relevant Redistributed Amount; and

(c)

if and to the extent that the Sharing Finance Party is not able to rely on its rights under paragraph (b) above as between the relevant Obligor and each relevant Sharing Finance Party, an amount equal to the relevant Redistributed Amount will be treated as not having been paid by that Obligor.

28.5

Exceptions

(a)

This Clause 28 will not apply to the extent that the Recovering Finance Party would not, after making any payment pursuant to this Clause 28, have a valid and enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

(b)

A Recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Finance Party any amount which the Recovering Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of taking legal or arbitration proceedings if:

(i)

it notified that other Finance Party of the legal or arbitration proceedings; and

(ii)

that other Finance Party had an opportunity to participate in those legal or arbitration proceedings but did not do so as soon as reasonably practicable having received notice and did not take separate legal or arbitration proceedings.


93


29.

PAYMENT MECHANICS

29.1

Payments to the Facility Agent

(a)

On each date on which a Party is required to make a payment to the Facility Agent under a Finance Document, that Party must make the payment available to the Facility Agent (unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date at the time and in such funds specified by the Facility Agent to the Party concerned as being customary at the time for settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.

(b)

Unless a Finance Document specifies that payments under it are to be made in another manner, each payment must be made to such account:

(i)

in the principal financial centre of the country of the relevant currency; or

(ii)

in relation to a payment in euro, in the principal financial centre in such Participating Member State or London, as specified by the Facility Agent, and with such bank as the Facility Agent, in each case, specifies.

29.2

Distributions by the Facility Agent

Each payment received by the Facility Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party must, except as provided in this Clause 29, be paid by the Facility Agent to the Party entitled to receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office) as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt, to such account:

(a)

in the principal financial centre of the country of the relevant currency; or

(b)

in relation to a payment in euro, in the principal financial centre of such Participating Member State or London, as specified by that Party, and with such bank as that Party, in each case, may notify to the Facility Agent by not less than five Business Days' notice.

29.3

Distributions to an Obligor

The Facility Agent may (with the consent of an Obligor or in accordance with Clause 30 (Set-off)) apply any amount received by it for that Obligor in or towards payment (promptly on receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under the Finance Documents.  For this purpose, the Facility Agent may apply the received sum in or towards the purchase of any amount of any currency to be paid.

29.4

Clawback and pre-funding

(a)

Where a sum is to be paid to the Facility Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party, the Facility Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other Party (or to enter into or perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able to establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.

(b)

Unless, paragraph (c) below applies, if the Facility Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves to be the case that the Facility Agent has not actually received that amount, then the Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was paid by the Facility Agent must on demand refund that amount to the Facility Agent together with interest on that amount from the date of payment to the date of receipt by the Facility Agent, calculated by the Facility Agent to reflect its cost of funds.


94



(c)

If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is willing to make available amounts for the account of the Company before receiving funds from the Lenders, then if and to the extent that the Facility Agent does so but it proves to be the case that it does not then receive funds from a Lender in respect of a sum which it paid to the Company:

(i)

the Facility Agent must notify the Company promptly of that Lender's identity and the Company must on demand refund it to the Facility Agent; and

(ii)

the Lender by whom those funds should have been made available or, if that Lender fails to do so, the Company must on demand pay to the Facility Agent the amount (as certified by the Facility Agent) which will indemnify the Facility Agent against any funding cost incurred by it as a result of paying out that sum before receiving those funds from that Lender.

29.5

Impaired Agent

(a)

If, at any time, the Facility Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, an Obligor or a Lender which is required to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Facility Agent may instead either:

(i)

pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s); or

(ii)

if in its absolute discretion it considers that it is not reasonably practicable to pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s), pay that amount or the relevant part of that amount to an interest-bearing account held with a bank or financial institution which has a rating for its long-term unsecured and non-credit-enhanced debt obligations of A+ or higher by Standard & Poor's Rating Services or Fitch Ratings Ltd or A1 or higher by Moody's Investor Services Limited or a comparable rating from an internationally recognised credit rating agency and in relation to which no Insolvency Event has occurred and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor or the Lender making the payment (the Paying Party) and designated as a trust account for the benefit of the Party beneficially entitled to that payment under the Finance Documents (the Recipient Party).

In each case the payments must be made on the due date for payment under the Finance Documents.

(b)

All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account will be for the benefit of the Recipient Party or Recipient Parties pro rata to their respective entitlements.

(c)

A Party which has made a payment in accordance with this Clause 29 will be discharged of the relevant payment obligation under the Finance Documents and will not take any credit risk with respect to the amounts standing to the credit of the trust account.

(d)

Promptly on the appointment of a successor Facility Agent under this Agreement, each Paying Party must (other than to the extent that the relevant Party has given an instruction under paragraph (e) below) give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Facility Agent for distribution to the relevant Recipient Party or Recipient Parties in accordance with the Finance Documents.

(e)

A Paying Party must, promptly on request by a Recipient Party and to the extent:

(i)

that it has not given an instruction under paragraph (d) above; and

(ii)

that it has been provided with the necessary information by that Recipient Party, give instructions to the bank with which the trust account is held to transfer the relevant amount (together with any accrued interest) to that Recipient Party.


95



29.6

Partial payments

(a)

If the Facility Agent receives a payment that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable by an Obligor under the Finance Documents, the Facility Agent must apply that payment towards the obligations of that Obligor under the Finance Documents in the following order:

(i)

first, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid amount owing to the Administrative Parties under the Finance Documents;

(ii)

secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued interest, fees or commission due but unpaid under this Agreement;

(iii)

thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal sum due but unpaid under this Agreement; and

(iv)

fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due but unpaid under the Finance Documents.

(b)

The Facility Agent must, if so directed by the Majority Lenders, vary the order set out in paragraphs (a)(ii) to (a)(iv) above.

(c)

Paragraphs (a) and (b) above will override any appropriation made by an Obligor.

29.7

No set-off by Obligors

All payments to be made by an Obligor under the Finance Documents will be calculated and be made without (and free and clear of any deduction for) set-off or counterclaim.

29.8

Business Days

(a)

Any payment under the Finance Documents which is due to be made on a day that is not a Business Day will be made on the next Business Day in the same calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

(b)

During any extension of the due date for payment of any principal or Unpaid Sum under this Agreement, interest is payable on the principal or Unpaid Sum at the rate payable on the original due date.

29.9

Currency of account

(a)

Unless a Finance Document specifies otherwise, the Base Currency is the currency of account and payment for any sum due from an Obligor under any Finance Document.

(b)

A repayment of a Loan or Unpaid Sum or part of a Loan or Unpaid Sum will be made in the currency in which that Loan or Unpaid Sum is denominated under this Agreement on its due date.

(c)

Each payment of interest must be made in the currency in which the sum in respect of which the interest is payable was denominated under this Agreement when that interest accrued.

(d)

Each payment in respect of costs, expenses or Taxes must be made in the currency in which the costs, expenses or Taxes are incurred.

(e)

Any amount expressed to be payable in a currency other than the Base Currency will be paid in that other currency.


96


29.10

Change of currency
