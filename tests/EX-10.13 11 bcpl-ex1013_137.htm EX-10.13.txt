it has established and is maintaining on the books and records of its office the following accounts:

Page 3

US3398832   116788-0237

 

 

(b)

Treatment of Property as Financial Assets.  The Custodian hereby agrees that each security or instrument or other property (whether cash, a security, an instrument or any other property whatsoever) credited to each of the Accounts shall be treated as a "financial asset" (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC); provided that, notwithstanding any term hereof or elsewhere to the contrary, it is hereby expressly acknowledged that the Issuer has acquired, and may from time to time receive, interests in bank loans, participations therein or letters of credit (collectively Loan Assets) which are not evidenced by, or accompanied by delivery of, a "security" (as that term is defined in UCC Section 8-102(a)(15)) or an "instrument" (as that term is defined in Section 9-102(a)(47) of the UCC), and may be evidenced solely by delivery to the Custodian of a facsimile copy of an assignment agreement  (an Assignment Agreement) in favor of the Issuer, as assignee, that any such Assignment Agreement (and the registration of the related Loan Asset on the books and records of the applicable obligor or bank agent) shall be registered in the name of the Issuer, and that if and to the extent any Loan Assets are credited to any Accounts described herein, any duty on the part of the Custodian to maintain such financial asset shall be limited to the exercise of reasonable care by the Custodian in the physical custody of any such Assignment Agreement that may be delivered to it; provided that the Custodian shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care with respect to the custody of any such Assignment Agreement if it takes such action with respect to any such Assignment Agreement as the Issuer instructs.  The Custodian is not under a duty or obligation to examine underlying credit agreements or loan documents to determine the validity or sufficiency of any Assignment Agreement or Issuer's title to the related Loan Asset, and nothing herein shall be construed to require the Custodian to credit to the Accounts or to treat as a financial asset any asset in the nature of a "general intangible" (as defined in Section 9-102(42) of the UCC) or to "maintain" a sufficient quantity thereof.

(c)

Actions Upon Instructions.  The Custodian, as securities intermediary, agrees that, with respect to the Accounts (i) the Custodian shall only comply with "entitlement orders" (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(8) of the UCC) and other instructions originated by the Trustee without further consent by the Issuer; and (ii) the Custodian shall not agree, subject to the foregoing, with any Person to act on "entitlement orders" (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(8) of the UCC) or other instructions originated by any Person other than the Trustee.  The Custodian, as bank, agrees that, with respect to the Accounts, the Custodian shall only comply with instructions originated by the Trustee directing disposition of the funds in the deposit accounts without further consent by the Issuer.

(d)

Form of Securities, Instruments, Etc.  All securities and other financial assets credited to any of the Accounts that are in registered form or that are payable to or to order shall be (i) registered in the name of, or payable to or to the order of, the Custodian; (ii) indorsed to or to the order of the Custodian or in blank; or (iii) credited to another securities account maintained in the name of the Custodian; and in no case will any financial asset credited to any of the Accounts be registered in the name of, or payable to or to the order of, the Issuer or indorsed to or to the order of the Issuer, except to the extent the foregoing have been specially indorsed to or to the order of the Custodian or in blank.

The Custodian agrees that its "securities intermediary's jurisdiction" (within the meaning of Section 8‑110(e) of the UCC), with respect to each Account and the securities account sub-account thereof, is the State of New York. The Custodian represents that as of the Signing Date it has an office located in the United States of America that is not intended merely to be temporary and meets the description set forth in the second sentence of Article 4(1) of The Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights in Respect of Securities Held with an Intermediary (the “Hague Convention”).

(f)

Bank's Jurisdiction.  The Custodian agrees that its "bank's jurisdiction" (within the meaning of  Section 9-304(b) of the UCC), with respect to each Account and the deposit account sub-account thereof, is the State of New York.

The Custodian will send copies of all statements and confirmations that it may receive for each of the Accounts simultaneously to the Issuer and the Trustee.

(c)

Subordination.  The Custodian hereby subordinates to the security interest of the Trustee in the Accounts, in all property credited thereto and in all security entitlements with respect to such property, any and all statutory, regulatory, contractual or other rights now or hereafter existing in favor of the Custodian over or with respect to the Accounts, all property credited thereto and all security entitlements to such property (including (i) any and all contractual rights of set‑off,

lien or compensation; (ii) any and all statutory or regulatory rights of pledge, lien, set‑off or compensation; (iii) any and all statutory, regulatory, contractual or other rights to put on hold, block transfers from or fail to honor instructions of the Trustee with respect to the Accounts; or (iv) any and all statutory or other rights to prohibit or otherwise limit the pledge, assignment, collateral assignment or granting of any type of security interest in the Accounts); provided that the Custodian may set off the face amount of any checks or other amounts which have been credited to the Accounts but are subsequently returned unpaid or reversed because of uncollected or insufficient funds.

In addition, the Custodian shall have no liability for making any investment or reinvestment of any cash balance in the Accounts as instructed by the Trustee.  The liabilities of the Custodian shall be limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

Indemnity.  Subject always to Section 9(i), the Issuer hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Custodian, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents (collectively referred to for the purposes of this Section 5(a) as the Custodian), against any loss, claim, damage, expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Custodian may become subject, whether commenced or threatened, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, expense, liability or action arises out of or is based upon the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, but excluding any such loss, claim, damage, expense, liability or action arising out of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Custodian, and shall reimburse the Custodian promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Custodian in connection with investigating or preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, expense, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.  The indemnification and agreement set forth in this Section 5(a) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

(b)

Limitation on Damages. No claim may be made by the Issuer against the Custodian or the Trustee or any officer, agent, stockholder, partner, member, director or employee of either of them for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith, and the Issuer hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.

(c)

Expenses and Fees.  To the extent that funds credited to the Expense Account are available therefor in accordance with Section 10.3(c) of the Indenture and subject to Section 9(i), the Issuer shall be responsible for, and hereby agrees to pay, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Custodian and the Trustee in connection with the establishment and maintenance of the Accounts, including the Custodian's customary fees and expenses, any costs or expenses incurred by the Custodian as a result of conflicting claims or notices involving the parties hereto, including the fees and expenses of its internal and external legal counsel, and all other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the execution, administration or enforcement of this Agreement including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, whether or not such enforcement includes the filing of a lawsuit.

Administrative Expenses. The amounts set forth in Sections 5(a), (b) and (c) above shall constitute Administrative Expenses under the Indenture and shall only be paid from the Expense Account in accordance with Section 10.3(c) of the Indenture.  In the event that the Issuer fails to pay any amount on the date when due under this Agreement because sufficient funds are not then available to pay such amounts in accordance with Section 10.3(c) of the Indenture, (i) the Issuer shall not be deemed to have failed to pay such amount (and a default shall not be deemed to have occurred hereunder as the result thereof) unless the Issuer fails to pay such amount on the date on which sufficient funds are available such that it could be paid pursuant to Section 10.3(c) of the Indenture (unless such failure results from the failure of the Trustee to distribute such available funds in accordance with the Indenture) and (ii) the Trustee and the Bank will continue to serve as Trustee and Custodian hereunder.

(c)

No Violation or Conflict.

(f)

Absence of Litigation.  There is not pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against it or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or official or any arbitrator that relates to the legality, validity or enforceability against it of this Agreement or is likely to affect its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(g)

Absence of other Agreements.  There are no other agreements entered into between the Custodian and the Trustee with respect to the Accounts other than the Indenture and other customary account agreements relating to the establishment and the operation of the Accounts.

7.Neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by any party without the prior written consent of each other party, except that:

Termination

8.The rights and powers granted herein to the Trustee have been granted in order to perfect its security interest in the Accounts and the cash and financial assets credited thereto, are powers coupled with an interest and will neither be affected by the bankruptcy of the Issuer nor by the lapse of time.
