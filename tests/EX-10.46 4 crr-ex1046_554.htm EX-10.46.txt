WAIVER TO CREDIT AGREEMENT

THIS WAIVER TO CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of February 27, 2020 (this “Agreement”), is made by and among CARBO Ceramics Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), the Lenders (such capitalized term and all other capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein having the meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement referred to below) party hereto and Wilks Brothers, LLC, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Lenders from time to time as a party thereto and the Administrative Agent, are party to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 2, 2017 (as previously amended, amended and restated, supplemented, restructured or otherwise modified, renewed or replaced from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”);

WHEREAS, the Borrower has informed the Administrative Agent that it may fail to pay the principal of and/or interest on certain Debt incurred in connection with the leasing of certain railcars and distribution centers (the “Lease Obligations”), when the same becomes due and payable during the period from March 1, 2020, until March 31, 2020, pursuant to the agreements or instruments relating to such Debt (such potential failure, the “Specified Action”); and

WHEREAS, to the extent the Borrower fails to perform the Specified Action, and such failure shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any, specified in the agreements relating to the Lease Obligations, and to the extent such failure would constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, including Section 7.1(e) thereof (such potential default, the “Specified Event of Default”), the Borrower has requested that the Majority Lenders (or the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Majority Lenders) agree to waive such Specified Event of Default, to the extent it occurs.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and agreements, provisions and covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby covenant and agree as follows:

SECTION 1.Limited Waiver.  Effective on, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Date, the Lenders hereby waive (a) the Specified Event of Default and (b) each Default or Event of Default that occurs as a result of any untrue representation or warranty made by the Borrower that no Default or Event of Default had occurred, in each case solely as a result of the failure to take such Specified Action.

SECTION 2.Conditions to Effectiveness.  This Agreement shall become effective on the first date (the “Effective Date”) when, and only when, each of the applicable conditions set forth below have been satisfied in accordance with the terms herein:

(a)this Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and Lenders constituting at least the Majority Lenders; and

(b)the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as of the Effective Date.

SECTION 3.Representations and Warranties.  To induce the Administrative Agent and Lenders party hereto to enter into this Agreement, the Borrower hereby, on behalf of itself and each of the other Credit Parties, represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, as to itself and each of the Credit Parties, that:

(b)This Agreement shall constitute a Credit Document.

(c)The Borrower, on behalf of itself and each of the other Credit Parties, hereby confirms and agrees that, notwithstanding the effectiveness of this Agreement, each Credit Document to which such Credit Party is a party is, and the obligations of such Credit Party contained in the Credit Agreement, this Agreement or in any other Credit Document to which it is a party are, and shall continue to be, in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects, in each case as modified by this Agreement.  For greater certainty and without limiting the foregoing, each of the Borrower, on behalf of itself and each of the other Credit Parties, hereby confirms that the existing security interests granted by such Credit Party in favor of the Secured Parties pursuant to the Credit Documents in the Collateral described therein shall continue to secure the Obligations as and to the extent provided in the Credit Documents.
